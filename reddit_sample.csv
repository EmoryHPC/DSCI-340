Comment,1,h76nvl0,NA,0,1627722333,"Long term options that have a long time to expire are riskier and thus more rewarding. He bought them in February. The legislature that affects them wasn’t cooked up in a day. It’s possible that he was lucky, sure. However it’s not a one time event for the Pelosi’s.

Comment,1,h76nipc,NA,0,1627721996,"I’ve always wondered why the insurgents would do this. If Jan. 6 succeeded, I’m pretty sure trump would’ve turned around and stabbed em in the backs because he would see them as a threat to his power. If they were willing to cause a riot once, they would probably do it again. Pretty sure the rioters thought they would get a presidential pardon or even government seats but no, trump is that big of a self centered bastard to throw people away like a scalpel",2021-07-31T11:59:56Z

Comment,1,h76m2lj,NA,0,1627720626,"Not quite.

See, as soon as you paint someone as thinking they know better than you, you can use that to attack many of their policies.

It’s particularly effective in poor areas where the main source of jobs is dwindling or even gone entirely, because the truth (“That mine closed for a reason, and the reason isn’t going to change. We’ll work to provide alternative opportunities and adult education“) is easy to attack with lines like “He thinks you’re not good enough for a job! He thinks you need to go back to school!”.

If there is so much evidence they should try him multiple times for different crimes with different portions of the evidence. Draconian sentences were invented for this particular perp. AGs of various states should be taking turns to prosecute his ass.

Being political? He instigated a violent insurrection against the USA, which he and the laughing criminal hyenas he calls his children ransacked too. There is wrong and there is right. And there is nothing between. Not even politics.

I'm so disappointed this orange pos is still a topic of conversation and he is out there spraying his shorts on how shitty our justice system is. Seriously. WTF are we as a nation? A nation of grownass adhd children led by posers with entertainment chops.",2021-07-31T11:21:41Z

When you go see your CPA every year in my experience They mentioned certain things that I might be allowed to do under the current law . Trump is an idiot.

He is not dumb he is smart cunning devious is devious and arrogant and that's the problem. He is full of rage and anger and numb to anything else I know.

I'm just like him. And i'm an idiot. I was ignorant too but I've been working on this for a while. It's a journey not a destination I'll never be well I'll always be an alcoholic I will never be allowed to have  Another drink.

Comment,1,h76kcvr,NA,0,1627719035,"Let the good times roll. Bon ton roulet. Kelly guilfoyle is right right wing right but nevertheless right. The best is yet to come.

The trump crime family's crime spree is over! No executive privilege. DOJ needs more attorneys I'm thinking. We the real people want our inalienable rights to be sure. Freedom comes with responsibility. 

No victims need to apply no People who think they are entitled need to apply please don't whine.  

We the people understand that freedom comes with responsibility when we decided most of us decided to leave a tribal society and join together for the common good we've it's good we agreed that under certain circumstances in circumstances we would submit regardless regardless of how we felt personally we it's out personally we would submit to the business of keeping our fellow Americans alive.

Is who information is coming out about Boston it's Boston and the smallpox epidemic of 19 0 1 and what was said then and what the Supreme Court of the United States of America said then.

Is Al we are a nation of angry victims and those victims are being bled dry is in blood dry by grifters. But they just don't get it and I no longer care if they get it or not.

I don't mind watching hundreds of thousands of backward ignorant jerk's die it doesn't bother me one bit. But I got mental problems I know that and I'm an old man and I just don't care anymore.

Is sick and tired of these people who don't want to work it's not work don't want to go to school don't wantna pay attention want a government handout is a government handout or want to be sovereign yeah baby.

It's unfortunately for me in my state we have 43000 members of militias. Terry Nichols is from here. 
 I have a farm in a backward and ignorant area of my state it's 8 and they've been that way for a long long time it's long time it's not just about the vaccine or the epidemic they can't function in normal society they're not city people they do not like city people they have a whole different code of conduct that works for them them and I respect that period

However when it comes to the common good ignorance is no excuse you want your family members to die because you and them watch Fox News stop it's news stop watching Fox News start getting your information from people who do not make money from telling you horrible things Rupert Murdoch and Lockland murdoch and the murdoch family in Australia are making hundreds of billions of dollars yeah it's a billions of dollars off of fomenting insurrection and lying to the people people it's entertainment they say they say when dominion sues them for 1.6 billion dollars they say oh it's entertainment have you ever heard Tucker Carlson's tone of voice.

Hectoring histrionics sarcasm but hes not laughing. He is not having a good time. He isn't having any fun. How is that entertainment. He is successful I respect that. Joe bonanno the only mafia don to retire was successful. I kinda respect that. 

RICO is no joke. It has asset forfeiture, money houses cars. Probably never happen to trump crime family. Dangerous precedent bsd juju.

 It's fun to think about though 3 o'clock in the morning the feds smack is fed's smash ivanka trump's door down and in her nightgown the handcuffer in front of her children and take her off to jait's brought to jail they seize her house is os in Florida and her property and her husband's property and they put her husband in handcuffs the cubs too they put their children in Foster care.

That's not gonna happen to her she's rich and unfortunately unfortunately another leader we might we might elect another evil president we've done that quite frequently in recent years and he or she could be the other party is the other party I don't know what's gonna happen to the nazi wing of the Republican party because they seem to be in the majority.

But truly brave people like Liz Chaney and Adam kinzigger and I'm not a Democrat or Republican I'm an independent in any case these 2 shining stars stars are going to do business in the name of we the people.

I am a member of weeds of people and I gave up my Is inalienable rights and I went down to the fire station and I got myself vaccinated in spite of the fact that I'm allergic to penicillin and I was wit's dependency on it and I was worried about anaphylactic shock I had that once I survived. 
 I talked to the nurse that talked and it called me on the phone to make the appointment and she said no biggie OK I was down with that period.

So I went to the fire station and told them. They had me wait an extra 15 minutes and I was good to go.

To uncover if he committed any crimes, you would need a full audit of the trump organization, and have the audit results reconciled to his tax returns

Anyone who isn’t a total ret45rd knows this, but the problem is unless there is some sort of official determination under the eyes of the law, this is not going to be enough to bar him on constitutional grounds.

Comment,1,h77ce5i,NA,0,1627740683,"So those are good questions, and the term moderate gets thrown out in a lot of contexts without a lot of discussion as to what that means. 

It does depend on the context though. Are we talking just within the U.S. or are we going talking globally? Globally the Democratic Party is basically center right. Think of Angela Merkel and Germany. They are the Conservative Party in Germany. Now compare their party and policies with the U.S. Merkel got along much better with Obama than she did with Trump. 

One way political scientists look at this by comparing the party platforms of parties over time. If you look at research on this, the Republican Party is the most far right of any major political party. There are parties in other countries that are farther to the right than Republicans, but those are generally small fringe parties that do not hold much political power. 

I also would disagree that “overall” the political discourse has moved left. The Democratic Party has moved left from where it was in the 90s, for sure. But that shift left has actually been much smaller than the shift to the right by the Republican Party. It also depends on what issue we are talking about. The only big shift I have seen leftward is maybe on several social issues like gay marriage. Public opinion has shifted significantly since 2000. But on most issues things have not really moved that much farther left. Again, Democrats have moved left from the 90s, but Republicans have gone further right. It may be a little confusing because the rightward shift policy wise of the Republicans really started in the late 70s, and the hyper-partisanship really took off in 94 with Newt Gingrich (and then accelerated again under Trump). Whereas the Democratic shift (again it is a smaller shift) policy wise has happened more recently. That may be why it appears that things have moved left to you. 

Let’s  think about the views of all Americans as a spectrum. Likely it would be a bell curve too, since there are fewer people on the far left or far right. Now imagine the median voters in that spectrum and what their policy views are. Those views on most issues are going to line up more closely with the Democratic policies than they do with the Republican Party. We know this because of opinion polling about issues. So if you consider moderate to mean, closer to the median voter or the political center, then again it is the Democrats who are more moderate. 

In addition to getting more extreme politically, the Republican Party has also gotten more illiberal. Illiberal means that they are more likely to take extreme political steps, delegitimize their opposition, and are less likely to compromise or work with the other side. That’s what the first study I linked in my first response is about. You should really read that if you haven’t already. That is a different form of extremism that is not bound by policy preference. Again, it shows that the Democrats have gotten slightly more illiberal, but the Republicans have gone way farther. They now more closely resemble Turkey’s AKP or Hungary’s Fidesz parties than they do conservative parties in countries like the U.K., Canada or Australia. Think about how Republicans talk about how Democrats hate America or want to destroy the Country. Or how a majority of Republicans don’t see the 2020 election as legitimate. Or the 40% of Republicans who think that political violence can be justified or necessary. These are all the result of an extreme shift in hyper-partisanship, which again has really been accelerated mostly by one side. 

The Republican Party does a good job of labeling the Democrats as extreme or radical, but objectively they are actually the more extreme and radical party. Again, all of this is empirically studied by comparative politics scholars.

Then it hit me, his family was merely abusive, but he blames poverty and geography instead.  

And it's a shame too because he's so close to getting it.  The part where he talks about having ""escaped"" his family because he married someone from a non-abusive house it's just this amazing self-awarewolf moment because he talks about how his sister who got pregnant very young didn't and it's like ""dude, that's half the point of abortion"".

Rudy claimed in 2 weeks that he would reveal the truth. That was 9 months ago.

We are all still waiting for some bombshell facts that will magically justify all this BS for the last 9 months. 

But feel free to prove you are not an alien. 

And the reality is that no one there that day thought they were just trying to delay certification. Even the evening of the election before enough votes were counted trump was claiming he won. In the next week he was pressuring officials to “find” votes.

Comment,1,h7783sr,NA,0,1627738362,"K let's ignore her 2012 stunt to show how stupid bills limiting women's reproductive health options were.. I'll quote from Wikipedia what she did.

> As a political statement against legislation attempting to restrict women's access to contraception and abortion, in March 2012, Turner introduced a bill to regulate men's reproductive health. Before getting a prescription for erectile dysfunction drugs, a man would have to get a notarized affidavit signed by a recent sexual partner affirming his impotency, consult with a sex therapist and receive a cardiac stress test. She said the proposed statute would be parallel to recent legislation written by male legislators restricting women's reproductive health and that she was equally concerned about men's reproductive health. **The proposed legislation was not meant to be passed, but as a way of bringing attention to similar bills targeted towards women.**

It's easy to pick out parts we don't like from a politicians career. There isn't a single politician I like that hasn't done one thing or another where I'd say ""k that's not cool"". But as a whole, I like the politician for getting things right most of the time.

He’s not only okay with being a brand, it’s what he wants. He knows that brands outlive the people that manage them, and brands create legacies. Long after he’s gone, people will still recognize Coca-Cola. They’ll still recognize Apple after Tim Cook is gone.

Many governors travel for this. And members of most state national guards are still engaging with their international partners. 

It is part of his official duties. And in the modern day, a governor does not need to be physically in the same state to manage the state. 

 Other posters mistakenly thought that there is no official business with Azerbaidjan, but It seems that you dislike him for other reasons.

>These ties are critical and must be improved now? Why?

They need to be improved regularly. This is part if regularly improved ties. And the US relationship with Azerbaidjan is very critical to NATO.

>There’s nothing more pressing for people in Oklahoma than this diplomatic mission? Really?

There probably is. But that is true for almost everything a governor does. It doesn't mean a governor can neglect all of their roles except 1 single ""most pressing"" issue all year round. Nothing would ever get done.

>You claim it’s the feds, are they pressuring the governor to travel there now?

That isn't really relevant. If the governor should only do things that the federal government pressed them to, then nothing would ever happen in Oklahoma.

>Obviously not. Why are you trying to deflect blame for an idiot’s poor judgement?

Comment,1,h77kt6p,NA,0,1627744806,"I'd say Obama, easily. Republican senate investigated him constantly and found nothing. 

Trump got off light in terms of a president. Maybe the lightest of all time? The media basically elected him and then soft sold all of his crimes and failures in office, then ""forgot"" about them 2 weeks later or so.

Trump was ""investigated"" a couple times by DOJ loyalists and that was that. Now that he's out of office the real investigations begin 

Obama was accused of everything from being a communist, to being the antichrist, to being from Kenya, to having be called a Muslim even though he's definitely a church going Christian. Trump himself even tried to do something no former president has ever faced: a campaign from a sitting president to indict him. Obama-gate was far worse than any treatment I saw Trump receive in his whole career.

In the case of the insurrection, I personally think he's guilty, because he never denounced the riots and is therefore either accountable for a deliberate attempt at treason, or due to negligence, since he was aware it was happening, instructed his followers to go there, was caught trying to disarm the defenses which that Pentagon guy stepped down because of, and he never made any attempt to ask the people to respect the voting process, and government. He and Giuliani then continued to sell the story that the vote was illegal. So, he is clearly politically aligned with the insurrectionists. And that's beyond any reasonable doubt.

A bank robber stole the money. Commuted a crime. Bezos or any other is just a company owner. 

He owns stock in the company. He has ownership and alot of it. The workers get what they negotiate for when they sell their labor. The stock price though as it goes up and stays high allows him to be wealthy. If it drops then he won't be anymore. 

I'm not ignorant of anything. Ownership in companies by owning their stock is no less work than packing boxes. It provides investment that slloesmco panties to grow, creates jobs and allows companies to serve needs of society. Stock price appreciation and dividends are a reward for the risk taken. Working a job is a guaranteed wage. In eating is not. Plenty of people have their money in companies who go under and they lose big.

Comment,1,h77jo8j,NA,0,1627744239,"It actually seems like the whole stolen election thing is just projection of the GOP again.

Look at the surveys made across the US before the election. They generally were rather accurate. However, in certain states, they were wrong in the double digits.

Hold on, I'll just quote it:

>The Republicans are alleging fraud in areas where Dominion election machines were used, like Arizona and Georgia. Arizona and Georgia both performed audits of their machines, and everything came back clean.  
>  
>The election results in Georgia and Arizona also, coincidentally, were damn near exact matches to all of the polls that were released, showing Biden with a narrow lead, and ALSO matched the senate races, again, almost exactly. Multiple races in multiple states, all dead nuts accurate.  
>  
>All of the investigations also revealed that Dominion isn't owned or operated by the Democrats (or Hugo Chavez).  
>  
>But Dominion isn't the only election machine manufacturer. They aren't even the biggest. That distinction goes to ES&S. ES&S has had a litany of issues over the years, and their former CEO quit to run for congress in a state that using his machines. He went from polling way down before the race, to winning by 17%.  
>  
>Gee, where have we seen that before?  
>  
>Maybe Maine, where Susan Collins spent the entire last year losing in every poll, by about 8-10%. She won her race by 9%. Roughly a 17% flip.  
>  
>Who's machines handle all of the ballots in Maine, including the mail in? ES&S. And since the race is soooo far apart, there will never be an audit of the equipment.  
>  
>But it's just like, one race, right?  
>  
>No. Of course not. This year, South Carolina spent $51 million on new ES&S equipment. Lindsay Graham went from polling down 1-2%, to winning by 10%.  
>  
>In Iowa, Jodi Ernst went from polling down around 3 points in nearly every poll, to winning by 6.5%. Just shy of a ten point swing.  
>  
>In Montana, Daines was within a few points, generally even, with his competitor Bullock. Daines won his race 55-45, another magical 10 point swing for the Republicans.  
>  
>Every senate race, where ES&S machines were used, we had crazy swings like this, and the results of every ES&S senate race went for the Republicans by so much, that no recount or audit will ever be performed.  
>  
>Back in Georgia, in the 2018 gubernatorial race, there was quite a bit of tomfuzzery too. Kemp ""won"" a pretty disputed race against the Democrat Stacey Abrams. Part of the issues revolving around the race, were that not only was Kemp overseeing his own election, but he had ties to the company who's equipment they were using. ES&S. The equipment ended up not having any paper back ups, and the results were all erased, so no audit. Oops. For this election, they went with Dominion, after Democrats blocked attempts to purchase more ES&S equipment.  
>  
>It's not like any of this is a huge secret. ES&S has been getting eyeballed since their tomfuzzery in Florida, during the 2000 race. They weren't the hanging chads, they were the ones that ""mistakenly"" gave Bush a bunch of votes in a county, allowing him to call himself the winner, helping to justify his pushes in court.  
>  
>Disturbing revelations have been surfacing about ES&S for a while now. Stuff like selling machines that have remote access enabled, allowing anyone from anywhere to access the devices and alter data and configurations as they see fit.  
>  
>But we will NEVER hear a Republican say they want those machines looked at closely.",2021-07-31T18:10:39Z

Medical Hypotheses serves as a forum for innovative and often disruptive ideas in medicine and related biomedical sciences. However, our strict editorial policy is that we do not publish misleading or inaccurate citations to advance any hypotheses.The Editorial Committee concluded that the author’s hypothesis is misleading on the following basis:

1. A broader review of existing scientific evidence clearly shows that approved masks with correct certification, and worn in compliance with guidelines, are an effective prevention of COVID-19 transmission.
2. The manuscript misquotes and selectively cites published papers. References #16, 17, 25 and 26 are all misquoted.

Medical Hypotheses serves as a forum for innovative and often disruptive ideas in medicine and related biomedical sciences. However, our strict editorial policy is that we do not publish misleading or inaccurate citations to advance any hypotheses.  
The Editorial Committee concluded that the author’s hypothesis is misleading on the following basis:  
1. A broader review of existing scientific evidence clearly shows that approved masks with correct certification, and worn in compliance with guidelines, are an effective prevention of COVID-19 transmission.  
2. The manuscript misquotes and selectively cites published papers. References #16, 17, 25 and 26 are all misquoted.  
3. Table 1. Physiological and Psychological Effects of Wearing Facemask and Their Potential Health Consequences, generated by the author. All data in the table is unverified, and there are several speculative statements.

My point was that before wind and solar were used, natural gas plants held that place making around 85% of Texas’ total electricity. And it was much more reliable. I really hate to talk hypothetically, but I do believe if those natural gas plants were up and operational, the grid would have been ok. Due to the fact that nat gas turbines/generators can cycle up quickly to meet increased demand. Where wind turbines/ solar is extremely limited.

I’m just speaking from almost 20 years in natural gas production, petroleum refining and co-generation operational experience. I was working the first night of the freeze and it was an absolute nightmare. Our instruments were freezing up everywhere. So I can see a lack of winterization being an issue.

Something DeBlasio AND Cuomo blasted her over. She has a BA in economics and international relations, but something as simply as a tax break for creating jobs seems insoluble to her?

And likewise, Trump has a degree in economics, and I still wouldn't trust him to balance my check book. Having a bachelors in a degree doesn't put you on a pedestal above the rest of the lower caste. Just like people who don't have a degree can also be correct. The point he was making in the article, that using the binomial probability formula, its unlikely that all districts went up at the same time, it doesn't take an advanced degree to understand that as a concept. And I think vice knew that too, which is why they went for an ad hominem in the title.

Now, with all the said, do I think he's RIGHT about what he's claiming? No, its more likely that either the data he was fed was collated in a way that lined up with his hypothesis, or he is acting in bad faith himself by gathering data to feed his point of view. Regardless of that, the things he is saying isn't incorrect about the binomial probability formula, and its not a hard formula to even wrap ones head around. But the fact that vice can not directly discredit his claim is only going to give fuel to people who _do_ believe that it was a fradulent election, because if he was wrong it would be easy to just point where he was.

I like almost everyone I've met there and take a weird pride in the work the organization does even though I have played an extremely minor part in any of it. If anything I catch myself being overly biased in favor of the organization.

Anyway, I think reducing it to a yes/no question is vastly over-simplifying things. Whether or not the president of the ADL is qualified in understanding what qualifies as a dog whistle is obviously undeniable. But it ignores Tlaib's intent when using the phrase.

You know, sometimes I think Russia has it right (/s): There's only one party, so everyone knows who the enemy is. Here in the US, we're simply split into two camps where each calls the other the bad guys. Americans just cant seem to grasp (or don't want to) that government is inherently corrupt. It might be a cynical post-soviet mentality, but as the years roll by and the issues in our political system become more blatant, the more I'm convinced that said mentality is not incorrect.",2021-08-11T08:44:08Z

The ""gotcha"" quote itself in context, while accurate and necessary, is also so banal as to border on the anodyne:

> ""I know you all understand the structure we've been living under right now is designed by those who exploit the rest of us, for their own profit. I always say to people 'I don't care if it's around the issue of global rights, and our fight to free Palestine, or to pushing back against those who don't believe in a minimum wage or those who believe we don't have a right to healthcare and so much more.' And I tell those same people, that if you open the curtain and look behind the curtain, it's the same people who make money and—yes they do—off of racism, off of these broken policies. There is someone there making money and you saw it, it was so exposed during the pandemic.


At the risk of being reductionist, if it wasn't a Palestinian Muslim saying this no one would've given it a second look.

January 6th needs to be a wakeup call to all Americans that our democracy is fragile and can be destroyed if it is not defended.  Elected officials, like my Republican opponent Mike Garcia, who voted with the insurrectionists to overturn the election need to be voted out. He is a threat to our democracy and we must do better.

As lucky as my family and I are to be here and be able to pursue the American Dream, we’ve had to struggle more than we should like far too many of my fellow Americans.  Medical debt, rising college tuition costs, the labyrinthian immigration system, and the increasing threat of natural disasters spurred on by climate change are real crises facing our country. These are America's real problems, and the officials currently in Congress are not representative of our country, so too many people are being left behind.  It’s easy to wonder if the politicians hear us at all.  Do they even understand the issues we face? Do they actually care about us? 

As a former pastor, I’m taking my days of listening and leadership to truly be a public servant who can carry the voices and concerns of regular Americans like me to Washington DC. I'm running to bring desperately needed representation for the working class, women of color, and the LGBTQ community to Congress. I promise to defend our democracy in a time when we need it most.

Comment,1,h8mnitv,NA,0,1628753526,"I'm watching Don Lemon on CNN. This was from Tennessee (idk where specifically). There were meetings for parents of schoolchildren and I can not believe how much aggression there is against people who are in favor of masks. One video showed a parent who wanted kids to wear masks being attacked, screamed at, threatened  by a parking lot full of parents who were antimaskers. If this man were not in his car, I'm thinking he could have easily have ended up in the hospital. No exaggeration. Men screaming ""we know where you live! You'll never be able to go out in public again!"" They kept repeating it. 

 At a meeting for parents inside (I'm not sure if this was the same place in TN),  a respiratory therapist and a pediatrician, both parents there,  were trying to get parents to consider putting masks on their children. Both were heckled. 

I've never seen anything this bad about masks in schools.  The level of anger was really frightening. They could have been like, so, you put a mask on your kid but we won't. But no, they were so viscous! These were parents! What's next? Their kids will mock or beat up kids who wear masks? 

I live in one of the largest cities in NY, right next to NYC. There haven't been things like this.  There haven't been meetings for my district over this. No doubt there will be some who won't send their kids in with masks or get them vaccinated if they're old enough, so we'll see what happens after school opens. But I just can't get over threats and all that that happen in some places.

The NIH announced a trial [NIH Remdesivir Trial](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-remdesivir-treat-covid-19-begins) the day before she supposedly bought, and it’s not exactly a secret that it would be one of the potential treatments.

Yes, I get that the important point is that he broke the rules but there appear to be no consequences. Then again, given the state of bureaucracy in this country, I fully expect that there are probably hundreds of thousands of clerical errors every day. Only the ones that fit a narrative will get any attention. In this case, everyone jumps on complaining about Paul profiting off of COVID when it’s pretty clear, at least in terms of the event in question, that they lost money. 

I don’t agree with the politics, and believe that people in congress shouldn’t be able to own individual stocks or otherwise sector specific investments, but most of the comments here appears to be made essentially based on the headline alone. Nancy Pelosi and her husband apparently bought upwards of 60 times the investment that Paul’s wife made in Crowdstrike, a company the DNC hired and is constantly brought up with regard to government cybersecurity initiatives.

>100 mg for injection

Now look at the stock price of GILD and then note what the stock does when Vaccines are first administered in December, and later when the Delta variant emerges....

Now if you need something more direct, here you go:

https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/remdesivir-gets-fda-approval-what-it-means-for-gilead-stock-and-vaccine-makers-51603461695

>Until vaccines end the Covid pandemic, analysts expect billions of dollars in annual sales for treatments like Veklury, and other remedies that get the FDA’s emergency use authorization or full approval. An antibody infusion from [Regeneron Pharmaceuticals](https://www.barrons.com/quote/REGN) (REGN) was given to President Donald Trump, along with Gilead’s drug, during his Covid hospitalization. Regeneron and its rival [Eli Lilly](https://www.barrons.com/quote/LLY) (LLY) are seeking [emergency authorizations for their antibody treatments](https://www.barrons.com/articles/regeneron-wants-fda-approval-for-trump-covid-19-treatment-51602165900?mod=article_inline).

So if you're invested in GILD and/or Eli Lily (mad don't have a conscience), then the less people that vaccinate and end up in the hospital, the more you investments will improve!

Just ask Abbot who won't even allow schools to have mask mandates but requested that sites be made available so that more people can be given Eli Lily's new treatment instead.

Still, I think a law that requires transition to some form of employee ownership after a certain threshold of ROI makes a great deal of sense from the perspective of reducing capital inequality.

I’d rather experience petty venality and short-sighted office politics in a context where a janitor has a stake than one where he doesn’t.",2021-08-12T09:09:54Z

""*Day 3*

*I have been leading the charge of the 13th Division of Patriots Without High School Diplomas or Formal Combat Training for the past three days.  I was certain of our victory and I looked quite astute in my gray uniform. However, a bullet grazed me on the first day, and when I rolled to the medic area, I was shocked to see that every tent was full. As I observed the men grasping for breath, I realized that most were not actually wounded, but were succumbing to covid-19. As Colonel Cruz walked by, he tapped my shoulder and wished me well. I replied, ""It's fine, I have health insurance and I received 3 million in a settlement from the motocross accident.""  A nearby private who had been badly wounded overhead us. The poor bastard looked up from his cot and murmured, ""That's a relief, I guess I'll be fine too,"" as he pointed to the bloodied stubs where his legs once were. Colonel Cruz and I looked at each other, knowing that medicaid had never been expanded in the state of Alabama, and couldn't help but laugh at his ignorance.  Additionally, I did not expect to encounter so many stairs on our march and my men keep calling me 'Wheels' when they think I'm not paying attention. All is lost.*

One high school student interviewed said that “not many” of her peers wear masks, but that at the elementary and middle school levels there has been more compliance.

The student said that when Wortman talked about masking, he invoked the framework of “discrimination.” If a fellow student wasn’t wearing a mask, the student said, “We were told not to discriminate or bring it up as much. Try not to be discriminatory, basically.”

>Thus, according to Olson, no one has ever observed a large agricultural society formed through “social contract,” or, through consensus by all individuals in society.

What does Olson consider to be a large agricultural society? Who is Olson referring to when he say large agricultural society? The Natufian culture exited around 15,000 to 11,500 years ago. The Naufian’s didn’t have culture and culture as in social taboos, religious  doctrines and laws? 

The Bandit problem: What culture is Olson referring to? Where did this culture exist, and when did it exist? I really think this is a good question, because without point at a specific known culture, you are  just making up a culture to fit your argument. 

**The stationary bandit will collect as much taxes as possible.** Based on what culture? 

>“It is no accident that the countries that have reached the highest level of economic development and have enjoyed good economic performance across generations are all stable democracies”

Examples? What about pro Capitalist China, Russia or Vietnam? 

>[Of course, I am curious how Olson would analyze the Arab Spring…] 

Or how the US supported the governments of Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Remember Egypt police were throwing American made tear gas grenades. Who cares about Libya or Syria? The Oil rich nations were a major concern of the US.

Comment,1,hbab31p,NA,0,1630564076,"[Friendly reminder that there is no state in the union where support for banning abortion reaches even 25%.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D6kr6a0WsAIPwLk?format=jpg&name=medium)

Chomsky, as ever, is insightful on this subject. Almost no top tier Republican candidates actually oppose abortion and certainly their bosses don’t, but by running on anti-abortion rhetoric all this time and transforming the party to be anti-choice, tons of low level Republicans (like state senators) are the genuine dumb article and eventually their earnest intention to abolish abortion is something they’ll attempt and the national GOP can’t block or they’re revealed to be disingenuous. And with conservative judges opposition to Roe being a litmus test requirement, the stage is set through 40 years of pretending to oppose something to actually revoke it despite that being wildly unpopular with both the general populace and the people who actually run the country.

>Since the 1970s, during this neoliberal period, both of the political parties have shifted to the right. The Democrats, by the 1970s, had pretty much abandoned the working class. I mean, the last gasp of more or less progressive Democratic Party legislative proposals was the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act in 1978, which Carter watered down so that it had no teeth, just became voluntary. But the Democrats had pretty much abandoned the working class. They became pretty much what used to be called moderate Republicans. Meanwhile, the Republicans shifted so far to the right that they went completely off the spectrum. Two of the leading political analysts of the American Enterprise Institute, Thomas Mann, Norman Ornstein, about five or 10 years ago, described the Republican Party as what they called a “radical insurgency” that has abandoned parliamentary politics.  
>  
>Well, why did that happen? It happened because the Republicans face a difficult problem. They have a primary constituency, a real constituency: extreme wealth and corporate power. That’s who they have to serve. That’s their constituency. You can’t get votes that way, so you have to do something else to get votes. What do you do to get votes? This was begun by Richard Nixon with the Southern strategy: try to pick up racists in the South. The mid-1970s, Paul Weyrich, one of the Republican strategists, hit on a brilliant idea. Northern Catholics voted Democratic, tended to vote Democratic, a lot of them working-class. The Republicans could pick up that vote by pretending—**crucially, “pretending”**—to be opposed to abortion. By the same pretense, they could pick up the evangelical vote. Those are big votes—evangelicals, northern Catholics. Notice the word “pretense.” It’s crucial. You go back to the 1960s, every leading Republican figure was strongly, what we call now, pro-choice. The Republican Party position was—that’s Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, all the leadership—their position was: Abortion is not the government’s business; it’s private business—government has nothing to say about it. They turned almost on a dime in order to try to pick up a voting base on what are called cultural issues. Same with gun rights. Gun rights become a matter of holy writ because you can pick up part of the population that way. In fact, what they’ve done is put together a coalition of voters based on issues that are basically, you know, tolerable to the establishment, but they don’t like it. OK? And they’ve got to hold that, those two constituencies, together. The real constituency of wealth and corporate power, they’re taken care of by the actual legislation.  
>  
>So, if you look at the legislation under Trump, it’s just lavish gifts to the wealth and the corporate sector—the tax bill, the deregulation, you know, every case in point. That’s kind of the job of Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, those guys. They serve the real constituency. Meanwhile, Trump has to maintain the voting constituency, with one outrageous position after another that appeals to some sector of the voting base. And he’s doing it very skillfully. As just as a political manipulation, it’s skillful. Work for the rich and the powerful, shaft everybody else, but get their votes—that’s not an easy trick.

The driving force behind the Republican minority continuing to hold power are the progressives who sit on their hands if they don't get 100% of their way. Our system doesn't represent the majority, it represents the majority *who participate.*

The Democrats are a big tent party representing a very large coalition, they very rarely pull in lockstep in the same direction. That's not a bug it's a feature, because the views in the party vary widely.

The Republican Party is a cult, driving an a enormous media machine pushing in the same direction and pivoting and turning at the same time.

The Constitution *explicitly* provides the Congress the power to regulate elections. The case was about a lawful and necessary election regulation.

The Roberts Court unconstitutionally usurped Congress' power by falsely framing it as a First Amendment case, which it wasn't.

On the day the Roberts Court agreed to give a stolen seat to Neil Gorsuch, it dropped all pretense of being anything other than a partisan super-legislature.

The Roberts Court is *illegitimate*, the worst since the Taney Court, and even less concerned with doing justice than the infamous Lochner Era Court.

Comment,1,hba7ptj,NA,0,1630561590,"Olson is a political scientist - and the link was a link to download the entire white paper. You can create an account for free, or if you attend a post-secondary institution, you can probably log in with you student information.

The closet example I can offer is the USA - we are the latest experiment in human liberty. Just know, nothing I'm offering you is stuff I'm making up. This is all subject matter I was provided with during my education at an accredited four year institution. Everything I'm referencing is peer reviewed.

I'm glad you brought up anthropology though, because I am a bit of a fan of the discipline myself, and I believe culture anthropology would have some really interesting things to say about our present society in comparison with perhaps the Tlingit's or Haida's of the Pacific Northwest Coast and how we utilize coercion to accomplish collective action.  


Here's some interesting content about the white paper if you can't get a download link: 

Questioning Conventional Wisdom  
  
In primitive tribes and preagricultural history, peaceful agreements between people may indeed last. However, in large populations which have undergone substantial agricultural leaps, individuals will not be inclined to advance collective goods, since the costs of providing the collective good will greatly exceed the benefit of the collective good. Thus, according to Olson, no one has ever observed a large agricultural society formed through “social contract,” or, through consensus by all individuals in society (568).  
  
 BNQ: Why do democratic governments form?  
  
Olson finds that stationary bandits are preferred to roving bandits. The latter would ravage the population from time to time, stealing everything that the people made. On the other hand, if the roving bandit settles and monopolizes the theft of a particular area, protecting tax collectors, then anarchy and the threat of roving bandits are eliminated. Olson calls this the first blessing of the invisible hand—that a bandit would “settle down, wear a crown, and replace anarchy with government” (568). The people mainly prefer stationary bandits because they know to what extent the theft by the stationary bandit will be extracted from them, and, the stationary bandit will always take less than the roving bandit, while the roving bandit steals everything from the people from time to time.  
  
 The stationary bandit will collect as much taxes as possible. There is, of course, a level of taxation which will decrease revenues for the dictator and the people. It would not be in the interest of the dictator to surpass this point of equilibrium, for it would lead to the detriment of both the dictator and the people. Also, it is in the interest of the dictator to use some of the theft-through-taxes on public goods. Wise public good investments by the dictator may increase the national income, which would increase tax revenues.  
  
The people prefer a democracy to a stationary bandit because the government and the people will benefit from reducing taxes upon the people. As Olson put it, “…the optimal tax rate for it \[democracy\] is bound to be lower than the autocrat’s” (570). This mainly occurs because the representatives in a democracy are members of the economy—not a single source tax collector. Thus the autocrat is interested in extracting rents from the people, while in a democracy the government is interested in the expansion of the marketplace. This theory, unfortunately, has many caveats in reality.  
  
Democracies, de facto, may function to advance the interests of a small percent of the population. Indeed, entire categories, such as the poor or underrepresented minorities may be ignored or further exploited. In theUnited States, special interest groups may co-opt and control the peoples’ will, therefore advancing special interests over the peoples’ will. Indeed, “A typical lobby in the United States, for example, represents less than 1% of the income-earning capacity of the country” (571). Thus, the special interests will advance their goal and skew social priorities, even though they will not broker like a dictator and “extract the maximum attainable social surplus from the society to achieve his \[i.e. the dictator’s\] personal objectives” (571).  
  
Individual rights are best protected by a democracy. As Olson notes, “There is no private property without government!” (572). A democracy is more likely to establish institutions which will protect private property, transactions and contracts over the long-term. However, for a lasting democracy to be viable there must be established assurances of free speech, property rights, contract rights, the rule of law, individual rights, and an independent judiciary. Thus, a King may live-long and uphold the former variables, but once the King is deceased there may be great instability. Established democracies are able to transition power and keep constant the strength of the former variables. Olson concludes, “It is no accident that the countries that have reached the highest level of economic development and have enjoyed good economic performance across generations are all stable democracies” (572-3).  
  
 BNQ: When does a dictatorship die and a democracy become born?  
  
Olson finds that the people within a dictatorship do not rise up and overthrow the dictatorship in order to install democracy, even though it is in their best interest to do so. He calls this a “logical mistake” (573). Instead, democracies are power players in a competitive global environment, and they demand that dictatorships become democracies “as a price for giving independence to the vanquished” in the course of critical junctures (573) (e.g., downfall of fascism after WWII, downfall of communism in 1989).

Comment,1,hbjt8yt,NA,0,1630746600,">...but some of the stuff they put out seems pretty damning.

This is the problem. They deceptively edit their videos. 


There's a series of videos done by a YouTuber on the history of the organization. It's thorough, so in the interest of time, if you scroll to 52 minutes into this video, he compares a video released by O'Keefe and the raw video of the interview. It's not just quotes included without context, but different parts of the conversation spliced together to misrepresent what was being said. 

The video was so misleading that Glenn Beck's website was actually the first to call them out. 

https://youtu.be/yJU0kheesnc

Additionally, I'm not sure if it's in that video or a later one, but there's a discussion of a planned encounter with a CNN reporter that involved O'Keefe intending to sexually harass and humiliate her on a boat. The reporter didn't conduct the interview, because a member of O'Keefe's staff was so concerned with whatever it was he planned to do that she warned the reporter beforehand.

I'll listen to your link, but if you have the time (and patience) to watch the breakdown of the video I linked to, you'll see just how flagrantly O'Keeffe misrepresents the truth (e.g., presenting the interviewee quoting something someone else had said to them as if it was their statement in response to a different part of the conversation). 

He lies. He's particularly shameless about it. And because people took him seriously, programs that a lot of people depended on were shut down due to the implication of scandal that later turned out to be unfounded. There's not much more to it than that.",2021-09-04T12:10:00Z

No. We don't, because not all of us live in the Faux-o-verse, like you. Acknowledging reality doesn't shatter our world view, like it does yours, because our world view isn't built on exclusively false and easily debunkable lies.

Number one. ‘Unvaccinated’ can in some instances mean anyone that is <14 days post the latest jab. 

So someone that has their second jab, but catches Covid within 5 days of it and ends up in hospital can potentially be included in the ‘unvaccinated’ patient numbers.

Do we kick them off the ward?

Number two. Some people, myself included, aren’t getting the vaccine because we have a natural immunity to Covid. (Believe it or not, this is a real thing, Covid just doesn’t touch some people). My wife (who has a weaker immune system than me) caught Covid a few weeks ago (she was still fine) and I slept in the same bed as her throughout, I didn’t get ill or a positive test. Pretty sure some here will still try to make me out to be some kind of covid denying anti-vax demon because of this, but... whatever.

Now, as an unvaxxed person, while I could understand, even agree, to not being prioritised for treatment for Covid related illnesses, what I’m not clear on is if I get admitted to hospital with something completely unrelated to Covid, should I still be a lower priority than someone admitted for the same thing that has been vaccinated?

Megathread: Recall Election against California Governor Newsom Fails,22534,poii2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/poii2s/megathread_recall_election_against_california/,6478,1631677939,"NBC News and CNN have projected that the gubernatorial recall against incumbent Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has failed. With over 60% of the expected vote in and nearly 8 million votes counted, the No vote (which would retain the Governor) maintains a 67-33 edge and a raw vote lead of nearly 2.8 million. While the remaining vote is expected to be more Republican and, thus, the margin will shrink throughout the night and in the coming days, the remaining vote is unlikely to impact the outcome of the recall.

Had the recall succeeded, Question 2, on who Governor Newsom’s successor would have been, currently shows Republican radio talk show host Larry Elder with 43% of the vote, leading his nearest rival, Democratic YouTube personality Kevin Paffrath, who trails with 11% of the vote.

An excerpt:

""You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. The director of the hospital now tells you, ""Look, we're sorry the Society of Music Lovers did this to you--we would never have permitted it if we had known. But still, they did it, and the violinist is now plugged into you. To unplug you would be to kill him. But never mind, it's only for nine months. By then he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you."" Is it morally incumbent on you to accede to this situation? No doubt it would be very nice of you if you did, a great kindness. But do you have to accede to it? What if it were not nine months, but nine years? Or longer still? What if the director of the hospital says. ""Tough luck. I agree. but now you've got to stay in bed, with the violinist plugged into you, for the rest of your life. Because remember this. All persons have a right to life, and violinists are persons. Granted you have a right to decide what happens in and to your body, but a person's right to life outweighs your right to decide what happens in and to your body. So you cannot ever be unplugged from him."" I imagine you would regard this as outrageous, which suggests that something really is wrong with that plausible-sounding argument I mentioned a moment ago.""",2021-09-19T11:41:55Z

Comment,1,hdfqy33,NA,0,1632036558,"They were applying longstanding constitutional jurisprudential principles. They really had no choice. SCOTUS was brought into it because someone sought an injunction of the law. To receive an injunction you must prove that you are likely to prevail on the merits. A number of parties claimed that they lacked the power to enforce the law. It merely creates a private right of action so people can sue. So how can the government enforce that? It cannot make people sue, and it cannot prevent them from suing barring taking the law off the books (but that's beyond the scope of SCOTUS's review). So who would be enjoined from enforcing the  law, which itself only allows lawsuits to be brought? SCOTUS posited that the question seemed to be asking for an injunction to enjoin state judges from hearing new suits brought under the statute. That's a very odd situation, and as SCOTUS found, was beyond the scope of its established power and it would not establish new precedent in this situation allowing that to occur. Particularly because the one private party in the suit stated on the record to SCOTUS that he did not intend to bring a suit under the law at present... So how can a party claim to be likely to prevail under those circumstances?

You are probably right, and the dissent seems to suggest as much. But I tend to agree that a preliminary injunction by SCOTUS is not the proper vehicle. Once a lawsuit under the law *is* brought, a defendant could seek a preliminary injunction of it, and a state judge could easily issue an injunction, effectively shutting down the law for the time being. Then that would be fully briefed, etc. and it would eventually make its way through the appellate process and be before SCOTUS again (potentially) on a more fullsome record, where they could actually rule on the constitutionality of the law. Note that a majority of the court was emphatic that it was not finding the law constitutional, only that the request for injunction by SCOTUS was not well taken. But another court could issue an injunction.

Comment,1,hdfoigr,NA,0,1632034678,"By turning himself in, it’s actually a somewhat genius loophole he’s found. 

The law pretty much says that citizens are essentially “deputized” to sue people for abortion, etc., etc. But no one can sue here because the doctor turned himself in - he cannot sue himself.

More importantly, the law does not invest the usual people one would think: attorney general, or anyone else who works for the state government, as being able to sue/prosecute regarding giving someone an abortion. That’s what makes this law so tricky - it takes the ability to sue essentially *away* from the usual people (AG) and pretty much deputizes the entire citizenry who don’t work for the government to sue in court over an abortion that took place. 

But this dude, apparently, just did an end run around that because if the AG cannot sue when this law is broken, but the citizen who reported it (and thus has standing to sue) is the same person who *”broke”* the law, again - how can one sue one’s own self? 

I just finished listening to a [podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/what-trump-can-teach-us-about-con-law/id1242537529?i=1000534839900) that talked about how this particular shitty law is set up, and if I’m understanding everything right, this doctor may have just found a massive fuzzing loophole.

I pulled the numbers out of my ass because it's late and I don't feel like looking up the data but that's the general idea of it.

Yours is a purely unscientific approach to the concept of life.  If you want to get technical, after spermatozoa reach the interior of the ovum, they are absorbed after donating their genetic material.  They cease being individual cells and join to become one.

The real debate here, one for which you've offered no arguments, is when does this cell become a ""person"" with all the rights and privileges of a human being?

There are all sorts of philosophical and religious arguments for when personhood begins.  None of them are rooted in science.

You seem to think all of the rights of personhood should be conferred at conception.  This implicitly places the rights of the unborn ahead of those of their mother, far before that clump of cells becomes anything even close to resembling a human being.  

The implication here, of course, is that the rights of a woman are suspended when she is pregnant - she suddenly becomes a vessel beholden to an entity which cannot survive outside of the womb and whose rights are somehow more important than her own.

How do we make sure women adhere to these rules?  We would need to implement some sort of pregnancy database where the government can track all unborn children to make sure their rights are preserved.  This is a concept directly out of A Handmaidens Tale.",2021-09-21T21:02:36Z

It's so frustrating to see people (who supposedly supported him before) disregard Beto over one, emotional comment about AR-15s *right* after his neighbors were brutally murdered with one.  How callous are we not considering the context and the authentic display of empathy/emotion for others, when our current governor has been directly responsible for thousands of deaths, endangered every child in public school, ignored us freezing in our homes for more kickbacks, and has criminalized women who don't want to be baby factories.

Conversely, if Manchin continues what he's doing Democrats will probably lose the House and maybe the Senate, in which case he's back to being unimportant.

If there's a subtle way to signal to him, hey, what you're doing is pretty seriously jeopardizing the national party, and there might be repercussions if you don't get onside, it's worth thinking about.

Comment,1,hdqsas1,NA,0,1632246348,"Thanks for the link. Which part of it were you using to justify the claim that the $3.5 trillion dollar bill advanced by the Democrats on a strict party line basis is Trump's fault? I absolutely despise Trump so please don't take this as a defense of Trump or MAGA. It's just that I don't see what you're trying to point to and would appreciate clarification. 

As for my claim. My reasoning is: 

The GOP has styled itself the anti-big-government party. That's how GOP voters see it. That's how most independent voters see it. As part of that, the GOP has created this image of being the anti-tax increase party. They have succeeded in this branding. 

When the Democratic party controls (at least nominally) the House and the Senate and advances a number of massive spending proposals and then the GOP refuses to play ball and it leads to the government shutting down. That is going to be seen as the fault of the Democratic party. 

It really doesn't matter what GOP voters think because Jesus could come down from the clouds and declare that he is a Democrat and the GOP voters would just call him the anti-christ and continue supporting the GOP. 

Democratic voters don't need to be convinced of anything because they're already on the Democratic bandwagon. 

Independents are the ones who's votes may be up for grabs and who can create that little marginal difference that wins or loses races. Because independents view the GOP as the anti-spending/tax party and because the Democratic party has been advancing major spending bills the blame (from independents) is going to fall on the Democrats.",2021-09-21T20:45:48Z

You’re also required to take 1 day every month for mental health and if you work there for at least 5 years, you’re eligible to take a year off studying or doing whatever so long as it pertains to your work or makes you develop a skillset that can be related to your work.  Some woman decided she wanted to learn how to cook, so enrolled in a French culinary school in France.  She had to pay for her own school but during that time the company still paid her.  Not sure what she did but studying methodology and new culture to promote diversity is good and remember, she did that for a full year.

Comment,1,heg0gfz,NA,0,1632724378,"The problem is that our system is built so that a relatively small number of people can stop anything from being accomplished and relies on the assumption that everyone is operating in good faith,

It doesn't work when you have enough people, in this case a whole political party whose only strategy is to just to gum up the works. I don't think that there is even an ideology behind it anymore, it's just contrarian for contrarian sake.

The more we compromise with them the further into crazy land they go. I mean ObamaCare was basically a conservative Healthcare plan run through their beloved private market and was pretty much the only viable solution short of nationalized Healthcare and you'd have thunk Marx himself had wrote the thing rather than the Heritage Foundation.

Bill Clinton pretty much bought into all of their shrink the deficit, pro-police, law and order premise, small government, deregulation welfare reform stuff and they hated his triangulating ass like he FDR incarnate rather than a fuzzing DINO.


This is why trying to compromise with them is a fools errand. Because the Republican party is not a political party its an identity movement and that identity is basically not being a Democrat. They don't actually know what the Democrats policies are, hell they don't even know what the Republican Party's policies are just that they hate the Democrats and those dastardly liberals.

If you divorce the partisanship from the policies they generally prefer the policies of the Democrats but they assume that the Democrats are lying about what they want because they are Democrats, the enemy and obviously if the Democrats want a thing its bad.

That's why even covid has been politicized even though all of the existing data and just basic understanding of biology and history tells us that limiting interactions limit transmission, you don't go visiting your frail grandma if you have a cold WTF would you go hang out with her when there is legitimate fuzzing plague going on.

It shouldn't take a degree in infectious diseases to see how countries and municipalities that enacted common sense measures to limit transmission have had fewer deaths.

It's not the hospitals in the blue states that had strong covid restrictions in place that are having to erect temporary field hospitals and switched to emergency triage protocols no it's the fuzzing red states.

There's no ""got vaxed and regret it"" equivalent to the HCA and if you have ever seen any of their memes you know it ain't because they are compassionate people with tons of empathy.

There's no sense to their objections because it's just about sticking it to the libs, there ain't no sense or deeper strategy to it. Honestly I think deep down they know full well that they are losing and at this point just want to cause as much havoc as possible on their way out.",2021-09-27T09:32:58Z

Lieberman is indicative of the problem.  Dems allow Lieberman (in the past) and Sinema and Manchin to get away with their colossal bullshit.  Republicans would nuke anyone in their party who were like them.

For instance a judicial appointment of a judge that is in favor of allowing the government to negotiate medicinal costs on medicine - on record.  Well, that would be something that Sinema wouldn't like, having taken more pharma money at this point than any other senator this year.  

Or some judicial appointment that  has ruled against fracking, or is on record for hard counts to percentages of green energy.  That would be an easy dismissal from Manchin who has been in Coal, Oil, and Gas's pocket for decades.  

McConnell can claim those victories, but they're not his, because he has nothing at the moment, he's a Senate Minority Leader.

Comment,1,hefypjk,NA,0,1632723078,"Yes, there are two taxable events, but the tax is on different portions of the final sale price.

Say Google awards its CEO Sundar Pichai 10k shares of Google stock in 2021. At the time of award, at the 2021 price of $3k per share, that's treated as $30M of ordinary income for Sundar in 2021, and he would owe ordinary federal income tax on that (almost all of it at the 37% rate, or about $11M).

Suppose he holds those shares for 2 years, and sells them in 2023 after the price per share has risen to $5k per share. Then he gets $50M deposited into his bank account for the sale, but he has a $20M capital gain (because the cost basis of the shares is $30M), which is treated as a long-term gain. So he would owe ~23.8% of $20M in income taxes in 2023 (about $4.8M).

A few caveats: (A) One common way for employees to be awarded stock is via RSUs. These basically work as above, but there is a separate vesting schedule (they don't all become income for you at once). (B) For large transactions like this, you must pay the income tax quarterly throughout the year, not just once at the end. (C) Usually, when an employee is awarded stock, the company will withhold the income tax for the employee automatically by automatically selling some percentage of the award to cover the income taxes. (D) With stock options (instead of raw awards), the tax treatment is different, and depends on the type of options (e.g. ISO vs NSO), and there's AMT to worry about too. But in all cases, at the end of the day, each piece of the proceeds from the eventual sale is taxed, it just can happen at different times and at different rates.",2021-09-27T09:11:18Z

People were sick of him leading up to the election last year, which showed up in the voting results. A lot of suburban moderate conservatives turned away from him. And then after Jan 6th, he lost the support of the vast majority of rational moderates on the right side of the aisle. Even if actual courts won’t indict him, he’s already been convicted of being a wannabe autocratic seditionist in the court of public opinion for just about anyone who isn’t a die hard koolaid drinker (yeah, I know there are a lot of them). If he’s barred from running, he could grant his endorsement to someone that doesn’t have his same level of baggage, and give them the push of his supporters. But if he’s not barred from running, he’s too much of an egomaniac not to want it for himself, and then he’ll bring his baggage with. What I’m saying is that he’s a good boogeyman for the left, and think it’s more likely the extreme right loses if he is the candidate. And then I also think it’s a lot more likely that he’ll split the Republican party, or at very least their voting base, between extremists and moderates if he is the candidate. I think that has to be a big part of why the Democrat leadership in Congress is dragging their feet on bringing about actual consequences where the most likely punishment would just be barring him from running for office. They’re always just posturing for the next election cycle, not what deserves to be done.

Debt and homelessness are way up, we're experiencing more natural disasters, the price of everything is going up while real wages have been stagnant for workers since the 1970s, and our political system is in a complete deadlock which makes it entirely unable to address any of these problems.

Right-wingers aren't crazy for recognizing this, or for feeling generally that their lives are being made worse by ""elites"" neither share their values nor give a shit about how they live. The problem comes in when they think they've found someone to blame, and surprise surprise it's more people who are immiserated just as badly if not worse than they are, or they try to follow another ""elite"" who claims he's just like them, and will point out all of the ""traitors"" in their midst's etc.

This is why it's all the more important that the Democrats actually push through sweeping reforms that will have positive effects on the material conditions of the average worker's life; it's the best way to deflate the nation's growing fascist movement.

Comment,1,hhq2oky,NA,0,1634979696,"Is this better context? Since apparently linking the article wasn't enough context and I have to feed it to people.

Biden told donors at an event at the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan on Tuesday evening that he would not “demonize” the rich and promised that “no one’s standard of living will change, nothing would fundamentally change"".

“I mean, we may not want to demonize anybody who has made money,” he said. “The truth of the matter is, you all, you all know, you all know in your gut what has to be done. We can disagree in the margins but the truth of the matter is it’s all within our wheelhouse and nobody has to be punished. No one’s standard of living will change, nothing would fundamentally change.”

Biden went on to say that the rich should not be blamed for income inequality, pleading to the donors, “I need you very badly.”

“I hope if I win this nomination, I won’t let you down. I promise you,” he added.

You've derived something else, when what he meant was a very clear statement to his wealthy donors. Vote for me, use your influence for me, bankroll me and I pinky swear that I won't change a thing that would hurt you. This is as bad as the people that derive some alternate context from the shit Trump spews. The only difference is Trump leaves everything to your imagination to fill in the blanks and Biden doesn't.

Get back to me when Biden's done and we will see how much he did to fix wealth inequality. I still believe him and know in my gut it will be nothing. I truly hope I'm wrong though and he recognizes that strong progressive policy is needed to protect the 99% that don't line his pockets.

You are so ignorant on health care. Quality and cost of care are factual. The stories about people from around the world coming here and waiting times in other countries are mostly fabricated. Meanwhile you are ignoring the fact that tens of thousands of Americans die every year from avoiding medical treatment because of costs. That does not happen in the rest of the developed world. The medical innovation you say is so  great here mainly comes from public funding. 

My good friend lives in Germany and she had to have her gallbladder removed. She had to pay €20 for parking and that was it. They got her in immediately and took care of it and that was the end of it. I had to spend a week in the hospital and I got more bills than I could count. Bills from the ER, bills from 4 different doctors, bills for the room ,the medicine and the tests. I had gold marketplace insurance and I owed $12,000. 

I now have a health condition that is no fault of my own, so I have to pay for the best insurance I can get. It cost me 16% of my take home income on top of the $4000 max out of pocket I will surely hit. I had to wait 3 months to get in to see a neurologist. They wanted me to take an insanely expensive medicine that cost $80k a year in the U.S.($12k in Europe) That took another 2 months of fighting with the insurance and changing medicines before I could finally get something.  

Meanwhile my friend in Germany who makes only a little more than me has to pay an 8% higher tax rate than I do. She will probably never get a medical bill in her life. If medicine costs anything it will be very cheap. On top of that her kids get tuition free college, she gets 6 months of paid time off for a baby and she gets 6 weeks paid vacation a year. 

Our healthcare system has fuzzed me over bad. If this happened to me in any other developed country I would be so much better off. I am passionate about this. If you think it is better here you are wrong. That is all there is to it. Typing this shit out is therutic to me. I live in a country that is shit and it is getting worse every year.

If a CEO were paid a billion dollars in earned income, he would be taxed on it. But if he's given an asset worth a billion dollars, he isn't. For the average joe to invest, he first has to earn an income which he is taxed, then invest that reduced earnings only to be taxed on it again when it is realized.

Santorum Surge
A homosexual sex act involving ten (10) or more males, popularized by several conservative politicians.

During this act each participant lines up according to penis size and voraciously jackhammers the male with the tightest cornhole (""receiver"") until they ejaculate, one at a time filling the colon with an emulsion of personal lubricant and fecal matter (""Santorum"").

Next, the second most hung male penetrates the colon extremely deeply and performs the most aggressive form of anal intercourse done at such a speed/force that the anus loses all tightness and what was once a happy starfish is now a hot red pit (""code red anal"").

Simultaneously, while the receiver is fluffing the most hung male and getting absolutely throttled in the ass, the most hung male grabs the back of the receiver's head and forces the receiver to deep throat beyond his capability.

The violent gag that results sets off a chain reaction that begins with a sphincter clench. The combination of this clench with a well-timed inward thrust from the #2 douche rocket creates a massive high-pressure colon-bubble that explodes at a high velocity from the receivers gaping colon, covering the #2 douche rocket in a mixed batch of steamy Santorum.",2021-10-23T11:44:24Z

The President would undoubtedly have received advice from health officials, policy advisors, legal counsel and others, but the decision to issue the order was ultimately the President's.

> Are those two cases the only court precedent? 

As far as I am aware, these are the only two Supreme Court cases to date that deal specifically with the legality of vaccine mandates.

>Just curious if there are any metrics that indicate what can constitute a public health emergency and what does not.

As I mentioned, the Biden administration is claiming it has authority to issue a vaccine mandate under the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970 (29 USC 15), specifically, section 655(c)(1)(A)-(B), which states:


(1) The Secretary shall provide, without regard to the requirements of chapter 5, title 5, Unites States Code, for an emergency temporary standard to take immediate effect upon publication in the Federal Register if he determines --

(A) that employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards, and

(B) that such emergency standard is necessary to protect employees from such danger.
 
Beyond this, there is no set in stone, bright line guidance as to when OSHA may issue an emergency temporary standard, and the types of metrics you mention will be specific to each case. In fact, the last time OSHA attempted to issue an emergency temporary order was almost 40 years ago, and that order was struck down by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in [Asbestos Information Association v. OSHA, 727 F.2d 415 (1984)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2262513958944201057&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr). If you read this case, it will give you some insight into the kind of inquiries the courts will make when considering whether OSHA's power to issue an emergency temporary standard has been properly invoked.",2021-10-23T11:31:24Z

**Work** is what makes money. Literally, labor creates wealth. You work in a car factory, you build cars.

Democracy seems like a reasonable solution to me. After all the business owner has an incentive to pay the workers as little as possible, so it doesn't make sense to trust the decision to them. Let all the workers at the business decide what their coworkers are worth. Of course this would apply to the business founder(s) as well.

Jeff Bezos salary at Amazon is like $90k, which is good but nothing ridiculous. He just owns shares in the company he started which is worth billions. And yeah probably you are right, obviously money can get you access to things not everyone can. But still your average American can avoid taxes if they put in the work.",2021-10-23T10:17:31Z

Comment,1,hhpvi37,NA,0,1634973247,"The scorching of progressive hopes and dreams was inevitable once neoliberal's gained control of the party. They had no interest in compromising with progressives and actively worked in tandem with the media to destroy their future prospects, with progressives only catching a second wind in recent times.

>The quasi-third way Democratic norms came about after the Dems failed repeatedly in the 80s with more liberal candidates. The party had to do something new after Reagan managed to convince a good chunk of the country that the expansion of government that had demonstratably improved lives over the past several decades was actually a bad thing. They almost certainly shouldn't have held on to power within the party for as long as they have, but they had a legitimate reason to become a part of the party. 

True, but I think it's odd that we blame Nade for Gore's loss but ignore Perot's role in helping Clinton. Not saying that you're guilty of that, but it seems like a common opinion that Perot didn't spoil Bush (and it's sort of besides the point). Anyways, it seems to me like Third Way Democrats used Bill Clinton's win as a sign that they were the only electable type of candidate, which they then used as an excuse to purge the party of more left-leaning candidates, even if it went against what voters wanted. Admittedly, I do need to do more research on past elections, but that's my take on it.

>Clinton was the best option of the field that emerged (and that's not saying she was good; she made a variety of blunders that were inexcusable for such an experienced political figure). Sanders would've been a walking punching bag that was untenable to huge swaths of the electorate, and nobody else who bothered to enter was a viable contender. Nobody could take O'Malley or Chafee seriously, after all, and they barely ran campaigns worth the few votes they scrd from the bottom of the barrel.

I disagree with this. Clinton only won thanks to the strategic cooperation of the media and the DNC. For example, [the media had a tendency to lump unpledged delegates with pledged delegates](https://www.salon.com/2016/02/25/hillary_is_far_from_inevitable_stop_counting_her_bogus_delegate_lead_partner/), in order to make it look like the primary was already decided. There's also plenty of suspicious activity, such [as SDEs oddly being switched in Iowa](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/05/iowa-democratic-party-altered-precinct-caucus-results-clinton-sanders), with even the 2020 Iowa primary including ""math mistakes"" that switched SDEs from Biden to Buttigieg. 

Sanders was actually extremely popular in 2016, to the point that he consistently beat Trump in general election polling. He also consistently polled better against Trump than Hillary did, sometimes by as large as 12%. Sanders was *the* electable candidate of 2016. 

Chafee dropped out earlier on and O'Malley never gained traction, which resulted in him dropping out early in the primaries. Also, I still hate the fact that the media was so rude to Chafee, with [Wolf Blitzer pressuring him to drop out during an interview,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SExMtNDS5hk). This was also a result of Hillary wanting every candidate, including Sanders, to drop out so she could focus on fundraising ahead of the general election. I doubt I'll be able to find it again, but I'm pretty sure this strategy was included in a leaked email as well. It's also a stark contrast to the 2020 primary, where candidates polling poorly never received the same pressure to drop out when they had no real chance to win.

Anyways, it would be nice if we could have had a real primary in 2016 and 2020 without all the weights on the scales, but the establishment Democrats aren't interested in fair primaries as much as they are interested in retaining their power.",2021-10-23T10:14:07Z

Let me guess the collective based on an arbitrary determination that this job is more essential to society therefore should pay more.

She was a Republican, and I guess her ballot picked the Orange Vomit. He also said that he wonders how prevalent it is, since it happened to his deceased wife’s ballot, how many other fake votes are there?

trump begged Biden to not hand over White House documents to the House investigation, but guess what - Biden doesn't owe trump shit, he's handing over the documents trump wanted hidden.

Now you're going to see (or maybe you'll still hide your head in the sand) how government moves forward with prosecuting insurrectionists. It may seem slow, because that's how the legal system is, and trump is trying to stall, but things are moving towards holding trump accountable for his many crimes.",2021-10-27T12:11:09Z

Comment,1,hi85lch,NA,0,1635325742,"I'm all for taxing the rich but not this way.

Loopholes and enforcement. Those are the keys. 

The real issues are corporations not paying taxes, and those who eventually do sell their stock paying much less on their gains than people who were paid wages.

Want to make the lower return more fair for retail investors or for those who invested long term? Let each year you held on to a stock or mutual fund mean 10% of your gains be taxed at the lower rate. If you want the entire amount discounted you want to hold on to that investment for a while. 

I'm ok with one person keeping controlling interests of their companies. Making him sell off stocks means at some point he's not in control. I unfortunately don't think he's done any more nasty stuff than a board of directors would do, he just moves faster and takes more risks. That means he's more directly the face.

Comment,1,hi84w89,NA,0,1635325130,"#In Congress, July 4, 1776

""**The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America**, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.""

They lived in a system of delusion, where their superiority was based on skin privilege that the elite of the dominant society promoted.

They honestly believed that their loyalty to state,religion and caste were the natural order of things. 

They based their entire identity upon  'what they were not'; whiteness and maleness must dominate over others because others are incapable of freedom for themselves, which is just projection.

It didn't matter if they were of the lowest intellect, skill or finance, so long as they were 'useful' to the elite, they could maintain the delusion of superiority.



Reality shatters that irrational delusion. 

The fact the a a refugee, born in a war-torn country(caused by US economic violence ) managed not only to gain citizenship, but access to the highest levels of office and power to affect change with actual merit.

She is proof that their identities are lies and they have nothing but the insignificance of exsisting in a world that treats them with rightful indifference.

When the stock market does well, those stocks raise in value. This is why he's the richest man in the world, for now, at least.

When the stocks raise in value, there's a difference between what they were originally and what they were after they raised in value. This is the gain.

Some of that gain can be siphoned off in the form of a tax. While this will certainly effect the strength of the stock market, I believe that spending that siphoned-off money - and the money siphoned off of the growing assets of other billionaires - on Biden's $1.5 trillion bill will ultimately cause the US economy to generate more value than was lost.

You gotta spend money to make money. Musk knows that, and so does the Fed.

Also, this is not (full-on, at least) socialism, nor is it communism, which I'm glad for, because I really don't like those two ideologies because they crush the individual drive to succeed and stifle innovation because greed is no longer a motivator. Socialism is the people controlling the means of production, and communism is the government controlling the means of production (both oversimplifications, but those are the gist of those ideologies). These are just taxes, and taxes that I really like. They are the characteristics of [social democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy#:~:text=Social%20democracy%20is%20a%20political,supports%20political%20and%20economic%20democracy.&text=It%20has%20been%20described%20as,reformist%20wing%20of%20democratic%20socialism), which is like socialism's weird, more individualistic half-cousin that I actually like.

On Friday 19 February, Albert Woodfox was suddenly released.](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/albert-woodfox-free-louisiana-usa-after-43-years-solitary-confinement-us)...Albert’s conviction for the murder of prison guard Brent Miller was overturned for a third time in 2013.  In 1972, Albert and another inmate of Louisiana State Penitentiary, Herman Wallace, were accused of murdering prison guard Brent Wallace. The following year Albert and Herman, both African American men, were found guilty by an all-white jury, in a trial that had numerous flaws.  The state’s evidence consisted only of the testimonies of three inmate witnesses, all of whom received favourable treatment in return for their statements, and whose trial testimonies were different from statements given just after the murder. There was no physical evidence linking the men to the murder; in fact, the only physical evidence presented at the trial – a crime scene fingerprint – exculpated Albert and Herman.  Each time his case had been overturned, Louisiana officials had appealed it, and then retried him.  In June 2015 the Fifth Circuit court concluded that Albert should be released immediately and unconditionally, with Louisiana state authorities barred from retrying him. An incredible moment for Albert, and for those who have tirelessly campaigned for his release. His impending freedom was widely reported. Yet Louisiana state officials once again appealed the decision and Albert was kept in solitary.

So yeah, I blame Biden every time I have to pump 4 dollar a gallon gas, every time I have to pay 10% more at the grocery store, every paycheck I get that’s worth 5% less than last year. I blame Biden every time I see a restaurant begging for someone to flip burgers for $15 an hour but there are no takers because people can get more sitting at home. I blame Biden when I have to wait 3 months to buy a fuzzing refrigerator because his useless transportation secretary isn’t doing his job. I blame Biden for the spread of blatant misinformation about COVID in children, I blame him for the DOJ calling parents of rd children terrorists, and I blame Biden for a treasury secretary that wants to permanently audit every bank account in the country. 

Quality of life is undeniably worse under Biden than Trump, luckily people are waking up and realizing this. He’s down to a low 40s approval rating, by some polls even high 30s and reaching new lows every day. 

Maybe in 2022 y’all will realize that your policies are so bad that even constant media pandering can’t make people vote blue when you don’t have a single enemy to slander.",2021-10-27T10:43:54Z

The second one:

>And in sharp contrast to Solyndra, the solar panel maker that defaulted on its $528 million loan from the Energy Departtment, Tesla last week paid the government back early, **with interest**.

In other words, the feds made a profit off of it.

>If you dig into the case the initial set-off/connection to the trans issue was that when there were hearings on the bathroom policy, the school board was asked if there were any sexual assaults under the current policy and they said no - which upon hearing, the father flipped out. That father's pretty legit anger was then twisted and manipulated by the GOP into a trans issue. But the school board should be held accountable for not keeping track or even knowing of sexual assaults. You could say the left downplayed it to boost the case for changing the bathroom policy, and the right connected it to it, even though really, it's a separate issue. I'm all for the inclusive policy, but the politics of it is gross all around.

>EDIT: Also, the assaulter was just transferred to another school where he assaulted someone else. The father and the victim are mainly mad at the school. It's not even really a trans issue for them, that's GOP twisting. Also the school sucks, inclusive or not.",2021-10-27T10:20:12Z

Look at Mohammed bin Salman holding billionaires hostage until they signed over assets to him as he consolidated power. Look at Putin jailing and then exiling Khodorkovsky. How could any American billionaire be thinking that's what they should work towards?

When you leave democracy behind wealth and status starts relying on the favor of whoever concentrates power and that favor can change in an instant.

And helping someone consolidate power doesn't guarantee safety either. For an authoritarian to truly consolidate power they need to go after and take out the the king makers that helped them.

The whole point of sex from a biological POV is reproduction. It's not like a car accident, it's like driving to your destination.

>We have the medical facilities to safely terminate unwanted births.

A birth so unwanted, the person couldn't be bothered to not have sex to avoid having said unwanted birth? Doesn't seem very unwanted to me.

>You are describing forcing women to give birth. Forced birth.

Is it a ""forced birth"" to tell a woman she can't have an abortion on her 38th week of pregnancy? Don't we as a society already tell most 30-39 week mothers that they have to carry their babies to term? 

The woman isn't forced to give birth, she's just prevented from seeing a doctor who will destroy her fetus. 

> It's way more applicable than the incredibly loaded and euphemistic ""pro life"", you know,

Oh, yeah, I agree. The terms ""pro-choice"" and ""pro-life"" are terrible. You are either ""Pro-Abortion"" or ""Anti-Abortion"".

> the people who overwhelmingly don't give a shit about the ""life"" as soon as it's born to anyone outside of their chosen demographics.

I believe that a post-conception offspring should not be destroyed. Whether or not I believe in social assistance programs (which I do) is completely irrelevant. 

>You guys aren't pro life, that's ridiculous. Forced birth is way more appropriate.

Once again, pro-life is a bad term. I like Anti-Abortion.


But yeah, if you have sex with the knowledge that you could get pregnant, I can't see how that's a ""forced birth"".

This isn't a very compelling argument.  

Only in extreme cases is a mother's life threatened during pregnancy.  And, in those cases, I absolutely think the mother's life should take priority over the fetus'  because she has consciousness and they don't.  

This analogy does not help at all with main question, which is, in cases where the mother's life is not in jeopardy, does the fetus' have a right to live and does that right to live supersede the mother's bodily autonomy?  

&#x200B;

>Really there’s no good answer \[for when life begins\], and for that reason I will always default to the judgment of the woman who’s body is inhabited by a fetus.

Just because it's an inconvenient and difficult question, doesn't mean we should sweep it under the rug for the sake of pragmatism.  

Where life begins is of paramount importance.  Because if you kill something which is endowed with the right to live, then that is murder.  

I have a hard time justifying murder unless the mother's life is in danger due to her pregnancy.  I understand that pregnancy and child birth are traumatic for the body -- I can't even imagine -- but I just can't value being spared that over the life of something that will become a child.  

&#x200B;

>No woman should have to go through 9 mos of pregnancy and childbirth against their will.  
>  
>Men need to sit this debate out.

Whether a fetus has rights or is alive affects everyone.  Fetuses become both men and women.  If abortion is a form of murder (even if justified), then it implicates all of us.  

I'd add that it takes two people to make a baby.  Men might not carry the child, but having a child or not having a child does quite literally affect them.  Not in the same manner of women of course.",2021-12-03T08:16:52Z

Instead of a woman who needs an abortion for her health driving 20 mins to a clinic, she has to have childcare and take time off work to travel hundreds of miles away.

Comment,1,hn1aynj,NA,0,1638510810,">“Consequences of pregnancy” is placing blame On the woman.

It's not about placing blame.  That's a literal reason people get abortions.  Because they don't want to experience pregnancy.  

&#x200B;

>Sometimes the consequence of the pregnancy is death for women. Maybe she has other kids she wants to be alive for.

In cases where the mother's life is at risk, which is rare, the right of the mother should supersede the right of the unborn child.  I agree with you, but this is a special circumstance.  

&#x200B;

>If you had an 11 year old daughter and she was rd, would you say she wants to avoid the consequences of pregnancy?

I think you're taking that out of context.  I didn't mean it in a derogatory manner, but descriptively.  

&#x200B;

>Or maybe you had a 14 year old who made a mistake. Should she be punished for the rest of her life by that decision?

I think whatever detriment the child is to the 14 year old does not outweigh the detriment of depriving that child of life.  Murder is worse than a person assuming economic and other burdens associated with pregnancy.  

Of course, in the event the 14 year old's life was in danger, I would support abortion.",2021-12-03T07:53:30Z

Comment,1,hn1ag8v,NA,0,1638510502,"It's true that not every Nazi wanted to exterminate the Jews, gays, and immigrants. Most were reasonably right-wing, but not frothing-at-the-mouth true-believers. We have the internet, they had -at best- a ""wireless"" radio. Fun fact: Hitler personally drove a campaign to get more wirelesses into German homes, because the station with the largest listenership was state-run, and therefore useful for propaganda purposes. Trump didn't have to make anything state-run, or lead an initiative to get people listening in, the apparatus was already there, in the form of Fox News, waiting for some demagogue to take their place. Go ask a Trump fan what they think of Hunter Biden, then go read [his wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden); you will note that, while the man is hardly a saint, Wikipedia's policy of requiring evidence for any claim means his life story does not tally with the conspiratorial lunacy Fox spent a year rabidly spewing about him.

These people are simply not exposed to anything even remotely resembling reality, never mind the truth. The litany of sins Trump committed, from kowtowing to Russia to lying every time he opens his mouth, are just... not framed as such. Everything, and I mean _everything_ is excusable, explicable, or easy to disprove (so long as you airbrush out some element of the story). Conversely, every mis-step, every thing The Powers That Be dislike, every statement made by the Democrats is unequivocally so bizarre, un-American, and evil, you'd be forgiven for thinking they were an unusually white branch of the Taliban. If even half the things Fox accuses them of were true, the country would already have collapsed into a Mad Max-style warzone.

Irrespective of whether or not they were aware of the extent of the evil being committed, or whether or not they were enthusiastic participants, the people of Germany were brainwashed, and so is anyone hooked up to Fox. They are, even if it's unknowingly, arguing, voting, and organising towards the goal of a more fascistic America.

Comment,1,hnb970t,NA,0,1638702435,"It's not so much ""sides"" as it is the in-group and the out-group. Almost nobody who's a giant proponent of hierarchy would consider themselves anywhere but near the top, and to be in the in-group is to at least exist in the top half.

The understanding of the in-group is that laws and policing are meant to provide them freedom and protection, without unnecessarily binding them or limiting the actions they wish to take. Those same laws are likewise meant to bind and limit the out-group while failing to offer the same protections (or at least  *deliver* them in the same fashion).

*This* is the reason you see things like people getting in fistfights with restaurant hostesses over mask requirements. The proponents of mask mandates and many regular wearers are generally out-group (at least to them), and Trump made the subtext straight up text when he made mask wearing out to be a declaration of animosity towards him and his presidency. When they don't want to wear masks (either because it makes people they don't like mad, they don't want to lose in-group protections or appear out-group, or just cause they plain don't want to) and then  *the law binds and limits their desires without offering a freedom they care about*? Some out-group twerp is going to point at law and tell *them* what to do, and they can't necessarily rely on the police to reflexively take their side over this...?

When you try to connect these dots forward to the newest insane thing they're on about, it all quits sounding so hypocritical. It stops sounding like there must be so much cognitive dissonance that's bafflingly absent. The hierarchy is everything. It is the station in life that God naturally intended for each of us. It's how the invisible hand of the free market has rewarded the deserving (and ensures punishment for the lazy and sinful) through the freedom inherent in it's design. It's why there isn't a reason in the universe to question whether or not Jeff Bezos ""deserves"" 200 billion dollars, and it's one of the things that make America God's chosen and preferred country.

1AM Saturday night, I'm reading on my Kindle, my wife is asleep next to me and our newborn son is finally passed out in his crib.  I hear the front door open and I think it's one of our teenagers coming in.  It wasn't.

My dog starts going ballistic, doing the ""SIR THERE'S AN INTRUDER SIR COME HELP"" barking. 

Adrenaline dump. I sweep my sheets off me, grab my pistol and flashlight, and head down the stairs.  I can hear from the barking that the dog is in my living room.

At this point I don't know how many people there are, but I know someone's in the house who isn't supposed to be there. I don't know where my teenagers are but my wife & baby are out of it and it's up to me.

I get to the landing, and start looking for threats, trying to remain behind cover as much as possible. Lo and behold there's a dude in my living room, sitting on my couch, looking at my dog.

I do a double take. I've got my flashlight aimed at him, my front sight on his chest and he's not even looking concerned. My dog is still barking at him.  At this point I'm wondering if he has a friend, so I do a quick scan and there doesn't seem to be anyone else.

I'm wondering what I'm going to have to do. What is he doing here? Am I going to have to shoot someone in my house?  He's 10 feet away, how much time do I have to react?

I wish I had had the presence of mind to come up with a cool line, but I said something like ""You've got 20 seconds to get the fuzz out of my house"" all while keeping my pistol and light aimed at him.

He looked over at me, saw  I was armed, and didn't even change his expression. He just got up and went right out the front door, with me tracking him the entire time as he went down the street.

After he was out of sight, I locked the door and called 911. Their response? ""Well do you want us to send anyone out there?""

The term ""Latino"" itself has a racist, colonialist past but whatever, I still use it because that's what we're called now. If people want to call themselves Latinx or Latine, power to them. If they want to use Latino, also fine. This is not a real issue. No one is *actually* policing speech--this is easy rage-bait.

Comment,1,hnkz2rf,NA,0,1638876963,"College buddy of mine worked for Senator Kennedy (Republican from Louisiana) for over a decade. Kennedy had been known as a reasonable guy and mostly a moderate. 

His staff (according to my friend) was quite similar; moderate and reasonable folks who leaned conservative but were definitely not lunatics.  

My friend says this started changing when the Tea Party started gaining steam. 

The staff had been very stable with minimum turnover for years. But as the Tea Party started taking over the GOP, they quickly saw a shift in the electorate which also started impacting the makeup of the campaign volunteers. 

My friend said Kennedy resisted much of this lunatic fringe at first. But as the Tea Party faction gained more power, his messaging slowly got more aligned with the loons. Staff started quiting and before long Kennedy's entire office had been replaced by Tea Party loyalists. 

Trump's rise to power in the GOP didn't start this, but it added gasoline to the fire and cemented the lunatic fringe takeover. 

I specifically asked my buddy if he thought Kennedy actually believed the shit being spewed by Trump and the GOP. I was surprised that he couldn't say for sure. 

He was confident that Kennedy knew it was all B.S. when it first started. But he said the main reason all the staff quit was because at a certain point it seemed like Kennedy at least started pretending like he believed the nonsense.

“… he remembers walking into a small side room and encountering two House Republican colleagues. “They were discussing the Twenty-Fifth Amendment—talking about phone calls they made to the White House, encouraging officials to invoke the Twenty-Fifth Amendment,” Meijer says. “Neither of them voted for impeachment a week later.””

> BEIJING, Dec 7 - The United States will have to &quot;Pay a price&quot; for its diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, China said on Tuesday, just weeks after talks aimed at easing tense relations between the two nations.

> The United States is set to host the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and is preparing a bid to host the 2030 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.Asked if China would consider a diplomatic boycott of Olympic Games in the United States, Zhao said the U.S boycott had &quot;Damaged the foundation and atmosphere&quot; of sports exchange and co-operation on the Games, which he likened to &quot;Lifting a stone to crush one&#039;s own foot&quot;.

> The diplomatic boycott puts corporate Olympic sponsors in &quot;An awkward spot&quot; but caused less concern than a full measure barring athletes, said Neal Pilson, a former president of CBS Sports who has overseen Olympics broadcast rights deals.

Comment,1,hnoxyv0,NA,0,1638947869,"I think it's cute you think the only reason Obama won was because some millennials voted. I voted for Obama and I am a millennial, but I'm not under any illusion that he won just because a few more millennials actually showed up to vote. Older demographics still showed up twice as much. And obviously he knew the young were not reliable, so still obviously represented older demographics and obviously the rich like Citigroup that funded his campaign. 

Candidates always pay back their initial base that got them through the primary and initial donors. That's politics 101. Candidates don't really care about independents that aren't affiliated that only vote every once awhile in general elections, except to coalition build and pander. What candidates pay attention to are party activists and involved people that can push them along whether that's donors, volunteers, strategists, and party voters. Not for nitpicky independents that flip a coin to decide whether to vote. But that's kind of my point. I would never expect Obama to give a fuzz about millennials. Maybe you were sold on it, but it was pretty obvious.

Until young voters actually form a block of reliable voters that are organized and get involved, don't expect anything. I don't. Apparently you don't either. Maybe Obama taught you something, but I have a feeling it didn't. As someone who probably spent hundreds of hours in the past few campaign cycles volunteering, you know who doesn't show up to volunteer or vote? And then you expect them to listen to you. lol.

I have a health condition that requires me to see my doctor every three months for blood tests. It's been over a year. I have no idea if I'm healthy, or dying. My doctor won't refill much needed pain medication unless he sees me in person. So I drink myself to sleep because that, at least, isn't subject to his schedule.

>[By 2011 — while in the White House — he had come around: He privately told his advisers he approved of gay marriage. But for public circulation, his aides wanted only to promote the line that he was “evolving.” To some liberals, Obama’s reticence reflected a lack of political courage. Obama “has liberal instincts and will effectuate progressive reforms,” wrote Harvard law professor Randall Kennedy in his book “The Persistence of the Color Line,” “but only if he can do so without getting uncomfortably close to what he perceives to be too high a political price.”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/01/11/gay-marriage-joe-biden/)

Aides had drawn up an elaborate strategy allowing the president to seize on gay marriage as a major civil rights issue. A blueprint for his announcement had slowly come together. The game plan had the president appearing at an LGBT event in New York on May 14 followed by a visit to ABC’s daytime talk show “The View” to reveal his change of heart. “I was just maniacal about order and planning,” Plouffe explained in “Obama: An Oral History 2009-2017″ by Brian Abrams.

From the article:

“Meadows’ book has reportedly angered Trump, who feels betrayed by Meadows’ accounting of his presidency — including a story that Trump tested positive for Covid ahead of a debate with Biden, a week before the White House publicly acknowledged his diagnosis. Trump’s reported anger about that revelation prompted Meadows to call his own book “fake news” after Trump did.

Now... if we saw a major company like Amazon do this, including their supply chain workers and everyone in their plants and centers, even if it meant hiring more workers to keep up with deliveries, THEN you would rapidly see other companies fall in line and super villains like Jeff Bezos could instantly turn their image around and be hailed as heroes.

Comment,1,hnotndg,NA,0,1638944466,"Who is giving 100 % of anything to anyone? Hillary didn't need 100 % of Sanders / Trump voters, she barely needed 30% on average in those swing states, 10K of the 48K in Michigan, 22K of the 51K in Wisconsin. Who the fuzz is saying anything about the 100% outside of you?

The argument isn't whether 100% of voters have ever flipped, not 90%, 70% or even 50%. When presented with such an extreme, dangerous, polarizing candidate, I'm stunned that even 2% of voters would flip to Trump supporters, Bernie tends to have the most informed voting populace behind him.

You presenting McCain / Obama flip numbers to bavlck up your assertion is absurd, McCain might as well be the anti-trump, dude was an independent, a warmonger for sure, but very moderate compared to the rest of the party. Obama was closer to an analog to Hillary, but just barely, Hillary had already been one of the most hated on candidates at that point, Obama was black, but he had change and optimism like no other behind him. I find it much easier to to digest that anyone Trump ran against in the primary had some supporters vote for Clinton, Trump was a monster in the 2016 primaries, he attacked his opponents wives, insinuated his opponents family was involved in an assassination, literally tried to destroy peoples lives simply because they were in front of him, that's a situation where I think it's natural to expect that a portion of that opponents base would hate Trump, refuse to vote for him and would vote for his national opponent. 

Black voters did make up 12% of the electorate in 2016, or 15.4M voters. 12 percent of white voters who had voted for Obama in 2012 voted for Trump, which was more whites than ever voted for Obama. So sure, roughly 11% of black voters who turned out for Obama did not vote at all in 2016, over a million voters, it's been stated multiple times that the majority of those voters were in states that they weren't going to live the electoral college, but I believe Trump might not have won if they all showed up in 2016 like they did in 2008 and 2012. But where the election was decided was three states where a total of 78,000 votes made the difference. Sanders had 570,192 votes in Wisconsin during the primary to Hillary's 433,739, Sanders got 598,943 votes in Michigan to Hillary's 581,775, and Sanders got 731,881 in Pennsylvania to Hillary's 935,107.  
in 2016,  11 percent of black Obama 2012 voters stayed home in 2016.  There were enough people in the voters who switched along with the primary voters who stayed home to turn those states. Just because you can say that there were other factors does not change the fact that a significant and meaningful number of Sanders voters went Hillary or bust and spent the national portion of the campaign doing everything they could to ensure that she lost, I don't even believe that many actually wanted Trump, they just didn't want Clinton, and they were vocal as fuzz about it. Many of these same assholes were pushing the same exact FUD on Biden in 2020 as Trump supporters were.   There is no changing my experience, there is a big group of Sanders base that is toxic as fuzz and they have proven time and time again that they'd gladly implode the Democrat party and burn it all down if they don't get Sanders.

In addition, it’s not their own bodies. they are killing another being that just so happens to live in their body. i can understand if women just became pregnant out of nowhere, but unfortunately she knew what she was doing when she had sex so now she must take accountability.",2021-12-11T11:11:18Z

If Obama isn’t in jail for treason for knowingly lying to the American citizens about the cia not even having the capability of mass surveillance isn’t treason or punishable by crime then again, the bar has been set and trumps antics are no worse. No one batted an eye at the rediculous patriot act that bush passed that took away rights of Americans privacy and we just let that slide, don’t let the trump hate blind you to just how bad presidents have gone to get what they wanted and I believe killing your own citizens and spying illegally is a lot more unconstitutional then the crap they tied to impeach trump for. Hell just recently Biden literally is on record saying that we don’t know for sure if the vaccine mandates are unconstitutional so we will just keep doing it until the court says otherwise, so basically he’s saying I’m aware I could be misusing his power in a very dangerous area but while he can oh well.

Comment,1,ho3myoo,NA,0,1639212893,"The problem is more that the voters aren't holding anyone accountable.

They're not punishing the Republicans for aiding and abetting it, first and foremost. We've seen a massive paradigm shift since Watergate, when the Republicans in Congress did finally move to impeach Nixon once it was publicly clear that his administration had been party to criminal acts, and he had actively conspired to cover up those acts. Why did they do it? At least in part because they thought the voters would punish them in the next election if they didn't.

But now we have complicit partisan media actively defending that sort of criminality, something **explicitly designed by one of Nixon's former aides to make sure that the next Nixon had friendly news media defending him** (i.e. Roger Ailes). Why should those voters care when they're being repeatedly told lies and spin and deflection? ""It's not a big deal, the Democrats are lying/playing partisan politics/etc""

Certainly there are many Republican politicians who are outright cowards, because they know the truth, but won't act or speak on it for fear they'll get primaried out by MAGA sorts.

> Register now for FREE unlimited access to reuters.comDec 12 - California Governor Gavin Newsom said he plans to use a controversial U.S. Supreme Court ruling on strict abortion curbs in Texas to design a law that would allow private citizens to sue some gun manufacturers, distributors and sellers.

> The Texas law was designed by the state&#039;s Republican-controlled legislature to avoid normal means of legal challenge, because rather than making state officials responsible for enforcement, it instead gave private individuals anywhere the right to sue doctors who provide abortion services in Texas and anyone else who &quot;Aids or abets&quot; the process.

> &quot;If states can now shield their laws from review by the federal courts that compare assault weapons to Swiss Army knives, then California will use that authority to protect people&#039;s lives, where Texas used it to put women in harm&#039;s way.""

He even said Hillary Clinton would be a great president and he would vote for her in late 90’s early 2000 I think. Also when did he kill 100’s of thousands? I never heard that before. COVID? I think he thought COVID would cripple our economy and he was running on being the economies best president! He was too big for his britches IMO. In hindsight tho we should have never had the lockdowns and people should have been able to keep mom and pop shops open. I mean if it was so bad then why was Home Depot Walmart and all the major corporations able to stay open but mom and pop shops forced to close? That never made since to me besides redistribution of wealth to the corporate elites. 
How old is too old? 70 IMO I think there is a disconnect with regular America at that age. 
Is trump to old to run again? Absolutely no one in their right mind would want 4 more years of him. Although some of his policies I agree with. I want someone who represents average Americans small town type not big city types with corporate greed on their agendas!

Why leave out NJ, we pay the most, get the least back and we're the reason why there's a senate in the first place, proving that small states can become just as economicly viable as large states, and that the Senate doesn't protect small states from large states, which is the reason NJ wanted two senators per state in the first place.    Virginia wanted people represented because they had more people at the time and we came to an extremely shitty compromise, called the Connecticut compromise, which Adams disliked because he said that the people will want equal representation and it'll cause problems if we don't have equal representation.  Turns out he was right

I think ultimately all Stalin did was create domestic chaos future Soviet administrations could not deal with, so they got more into expanding Communism into 3rd world countries because they could not fix things at home.

Again, instead of trying to fix their economy they then got into a war with Afghanistan that was probably the death blow. Gorbachev threw up his hands and said ""communism can't fix out economy, maybe Capitalism can""

Unfortunately, no subsequent supposedly 'capitalist' Russian Presidents seem able to deal with the economy either.",2021-12-13T09:45:07Z

The problem is that I don't think the U.S. govt intends to arrest and put him on trial. Almost all presidents have broken laws over the years. If Trump goes to trial and jail then a new president will be set that former presidents that are criminals can and should be jailed for the crimes in office.

Comment,1,hocskt1,NA,0,1639381319,"Christopher Hitchens said it best:

“Let's say that the consensus is that our species, being the higher primates, Homo Sapiens, has been on the planet for at least 100,000 years, maybe more. Francis Collins says maybe 100,000. Richard Dawkins thinks maybe a quarter-of-a-million. I'll take 100,000. In order to be a Christian, you have to believe that for 98,000 years, our species suffered and died, most of its children dying in childbirth, most other people having a life expectancy of about 25 years, dying of their teeth. Famine, struggle, bitterness, war, suffering, misery, all of that for 98,000 years.

Heaven watches this with complete indifference. And then 2000 years ago, thinks 'That's enough of that. It's time to intervene,' and the best way to do this would be by condemning someone to a human sacrifice somewhere in the less literate parts of the Middle East. Don't lets appeal to the Chinese, for example, where people can read and study evidence and have a civilization. Let's go to the desert and have another revelation there. This is nonsense. It can't be believed by a thinking person.

Why am I glad this is the case? To get to the point of the wrongness of Christianity, because I think the teachings of Christianity are immoral. The central one is the most immoral of all, and that is the one of vicarious redemption. You can throw your sins onto somebody else, vulgarly known as scapegoating. In fact, originating as scapegoating in the same area, the same desert. I can pay your debt if I love you. I can serve your term in prison if I love you very much. I can volunteer to do that. I can't take your sins away, because I can't abolish your responsibility, and I shouldn't offer to do so. Your responsibility has to stay with you. There's no vicarious redemption. There very probably, in fact, is no redemption at all. It's just a part of wish-thinking, and I don't think wish-thinking is good for people either.

It even manages to pollute the central question, the word I just employed, the most important word of all: the word love, by making love compulsory, by saying you MUST love. You must love your neighbour as yourself, something you can't actually do. You'll always fall short, so you can always be found guilty. By saying you must love someone who you also must fear. That's to say a supreme being, an eternal father, someone of whom you must be afraid, but you must love him, too. If you fail in this duty, you're again a wretched sinner. This is not mentally or morally or intellectually healthy.

And that brings me to the final objection - I'll condense it, Dr. Orlafsky - which is, this is a totalitarian system. If there was a God who could do these things and demand these things of us, and he was eternal and unchanging, we'd be living under a dictatorship from which there is no appeal, and one that can never change and one that knows our thoughts and can convict us of thought crime, and condemn us to eternal punishment for actions that we are condemned in advance to be taking. All this in the round, and I could say more, it's an excellent thing that we have absolutely no reason to believe any of it to be true.”",2021-12-13T09:41:59Z

Comment,1,hocsj19,NA,0,1639381280,"WASHINGTON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - A video feed of a Taiwanese minister was cut during U.S. President Joe Biden's Summit for Democracy last week after a map in her slide presentation showed Taiwan in a different color to China, which claims the island as its own.  
  
Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Friday's slide show by Taiwanese Digital Minister Audrey Tang caused consternation among U.S. officials after the map appeared in her video feed for about a minute.  
  
The sources, who did not want to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the video feed showing Tang was cut during a panel discussion and replaced with audio only - at the behest of the White House.  
  
The White House was concerned that differentiating Taiwan and China on a map in a U.S.-hosted conference - to which Taiwan had been invited in a show of support at a time when it is under intense pressure from Beijing - could be seen as being at odds with Washington's ""one-China"" policy, which avoids taking a position as to whether Taiwan is part of China, the sources said.  
  
The State Department said ""confusion"" over screen-sharing resulted in Tang's video feed being dropped, calling it ""an honest mistake.""  
  
""We valued Minister Tang's participation, which showcased Taiwan's world-class expertise on issues of transparent governance, human rights, and countering disinformation,"" a spokesperson said.  
  
Tang's presentation included a color-coded map from South African NGO CIVICUS, ranking the world by openness on civil rights.  
  
Most of Asia was shown, with Taiwan colored green, making it the only regional entity portrayed as ""open,"" while all the others, including several U.S. allies and partners, were labeled as being ""closed,"" ""repressed,"" ""obstructed"" or ""narrowed.""  
  
China, Laos, Vietnam and North Korea were colored red and labeled ""closed.""  
  
When the moderator returned to Tang a few minutes later, there was no video of her, just audio, and a screenshot captioned: ""Minister Audrey Tang Taiwan."" An onscreen disclaimer later declared: ""Any opinions expressed by individuals on this panel are those of the individual, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the United States government.""  
  
One source told Reuters the map generated an instant email flurry among U.S. officials and the White House National Security Council (NSC) angrily contacted the State Department, concerned it appeared to show Taiwan as a distinct country.  
  
Washington complained to Taiwan's government, which in turn was angry that Tang's video had been cut.  
  
The source called the U.S. move an over-reaction as the map was not inherently about national boundaries, but the NSC was also angry as the slide had not appeared in ""dry-run"" versions of the presentation before the summit, raising questions as to whether there was intentional messaging by Tang and Taiwan.  
  
""They choked,"" the source said of the White House reaction.  
  
A second source directly involved in the summit said the video booth operator acted on White House instructions. ""It was clearly policy concerns,"" the source said, adding: ""This was completely an internal overreaction.""  
  
The sources saw the move during a panel on ""countering digital authoritarianism"" as at odds with the summit's mission of bolstering democracy in the face of challenges from China and others. They also said it could signal that the administration's support for Taiwan was not as ""rock solid"" as it has repeatedly stated.  
  
An NSC spokesman said Reuters' account of the incident was ""inaccurate"".  
  
""At no time did the White House direct that Minister Tang's video feed be cut,"" the spokesman said in an email, also blaming it on confusion over screen-sharing and adding that the full video could be viewed on the summit web page.  
  
Asked whether she believed the U.S. government cut the video due to the slide, Tang told Reuters in an email: ""No, I do not believe that this has anything to do with the CIVICUS map in my slides, or U.S. allies in Asia for that matter.""  
  
Taiwan's foreign ministry blamed ""technical problems.""  
  
It later said Tang's presentation had been provided in advance and not shown at the last minute.  
  
""Taiwan and the United States have fully communicated on this technical issue, and the two sides have a solid mutual trust and a solid and friendly relationship,"" it said.  
  
The issue comes at a highly sensitive time for U.S.-Taiwan relations, when some Biden administration critics and foreign policy experts are calling for more overt shows of support for the island, including an end to a long-held policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" as to whether the United States would defend it militarily.  
  
Taiwan experts said they did not see the color-coding of the map as a violation of unofficial U.S. guidelines, which bar use of overt symbols of sovereignty, such as Taiwan's flag.  
  
""It was clearly not to distinguish sovereignty, but the degree of democratic expression,"" said Douglas Paal, a former unofficial U.S. ambassador to Taiwan.  
  
Under U.S. government guidelines as of 2020, U.S. government maps showing sovereignty by color require Taiwan to be shown with the same color as China, although exceptions can be made ""when context requires that Taiwan be specifically singled out.""  
  
Bonnie Glaser of the German Marshall Fund of the United States said the guidelines would not apply to a non-U.S. government map, ""but the U.S. would likely want to avoid appearing to endorse that Taiwan is not part of China.""  
  
""It seems to me that a decision was made at the outset that Taiwan could/should be included in the Summit for Democracy, but only in ways consistent with U.S. policy.""",2021-12-13T09:41:20Z

What usually happens is that the offending religious items are immediately removed from public property rather than allow the Satanic Temple to pass out its religious literature or set up statues.

---

As of Nov. 3rd the problem Trump had to solve is this: ""How do I retain the presidency even though I lost the electoral college?""

Let's start by reverse engineering the problem...

How do I retain the presidency even though I lost the electoral college?

The only viable path to victory is to force a contingent election whereby congress decides who is the next president. (we've already done the math and you have the numbers to win.)

How do I force a contingent election?

At this point the only viable way is to make sure that the conditions required to certify the electoral college are not met.

How do I make sure those conditional requirements are not met?

If you can delay the certification for even 1 day then legally the conditional requirements will not have been met.

How do I delay the certification for even 1 day?

The VP is the lynch pin in to the electoral college process. You have to keep the VP from completing the electoral college certification process on the 6th of January.

How do I keep the VP from completing the electoral college certification process on the 6th ofJanuary?

Get the VP to leave the capitol before the electoral college certification is complete.

How do I get the VP to leave the capitol before the electoral college certification is complete?

The VP has to want to leave the capitol.

How do I get the VP to want to leave the capitol?

If his life and the lives of his family were at risk he would want to leave the capitol. 

How could his life and his family's lives be put at risk?

If he and his family were in the capitol building and it came under attack their lives would be at risk.

How could the capitol building come under attack?

A protest could easily get out of hand and become a riot aimed at the capitol building.

How can I make sure there is a protest on the day of the electoral college certification at the capitol? 

Announce a rally to be scheduled on January 6th at the capitol and promote it heavily.

But Pence is my VP he's been 100% loyal to me. Even if there was a riot, why would the people attacking the capitol turn on Pence?

We would have to give the rioters a reason to turn on Pence.

How do we give the rioters a reason to turn on Pence?

Have a very publicized meeting just before Jan 6th and ask Pence to just overturn the electoral college even though the states already certified the results. All while knowing it's not within Pences constitutional powers and that he will not agree to do it. Then blame him very publicly when he actually doesn't do it. Blame him while the riot is happening even.

How do we know the protest will have enough time to turn into a riot that will cause the evacuation of Pence before the certification? 

We will call friendly republican senators during the electoral college certification and get them to object as much as possible as to delay the certification as long as possible.

How do we make sure the protest will turn into a riot?

Hold a rally before the protest and really convince the crowd that if the electoral college is successful in certifying the election the country will be destroyed and they will have been cheated out of an election. Tell them it's time to kick ass and take names. Tell them it's time for trial by combat. Tell them it's their last chance to save America.

How do we know the rioters will invade the capitol?

We would need to communicate with protest organizers in the crowd that could lead and incite the rioters.

How would we communicate with both the friendly senators and the protest leaders in the crowd?

We would have people keep in touch with protest organizers on the ground and also set up a command center where calls could be made to senators and others.

How would I keep the national guard from deploying and stopping the riot before Pence evacuates?

You would have to place people in charge at the pentagon who will delay deployment of the national guard.

That sounds like it could actually work. 

So the plan is...

Step 1. Convince a large number of supporters that mass election fraud caused the election to be stolen from them.

https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-tweets-he-won-not-conceding-9ce22e9dc90577f7365d150c151a91c7

Step 2.Announce a rally to ""Stop the Steal"" scheduled on the same day at the same location where the electoral college certification is taking place. Have the rally end right before the certification begins. 

https://www.fox5dc.com/news/trump-promises-wild-protest-in-dc-on-jan-6-the-day-congress-to-count-electoral-votes

Step 3. Place leadership at the pentagon who will delay the deployment of the national guard.

https://www.npr.org/2021/03/03/973292523/dod-took-hours-to-approve-national-guard-request-during-capitol-riot-commander-s

Step 4. Before the rally, setup a communications command center at the Willard Hotel.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/willard-trump-eastman-giuliani-bannon/2021/10/23/c45bd2d4-3281-11ec-9241-aad8e48f01ff_story.html

Step 5. Right before the rally, have a meeting with Pence and ask him to ignore the electoral college results and send the election to congress. The morning of the certification before the rally send out a tweet again encouraging Pence to hand the election to trump. (knowing full well he wont do it.)

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-leans-harder-pence-flip-election-results-n1252849

Step 6. At the rally, have speakers use very violent rhetoric to really stir up the crowd and then direct them to march on the capitol.

https://www.npr.org/2021/02/10/966396848/read-trumps-jan-6-speech-a-key-part-of-impeachment-trial

Step 7. During the riot tweet that Pence ""didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and Constitution."" 

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-pence-tweet-capitol-riot-impeachment-trial_n_6024b281c5b6b295bc045640

Step 8. In the command center where calls are already going out to senators to get them to object to delay certification, begin having people communicate with protest organizers on the ground to lead and incite the crowd to invade the capitol and turn on Pence. (the capitol is breached and ""hang mike pence!"" chants begin)

https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/01/11/capitol-assault-a-more-sinister-attack-than-first-appeared

Step 9. Watch and wait for Pence to evacuate the Capitol to escape the invading rioters calling for his death.

https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-ignored-plea-stop-capitol-rioters-kept-watching-tv-book-2021-9

Step 10. Once Pence has left the Capitol and the conditional requirements to certify the electoral college are not met, argue that legally the election has no alternative but to be declared a contingent election. Whereby congress would then have to reconvene and vote to elect the next president instead of voting to confirm the outcome of the electoral college.

https://www.findlaw.com/voting/how-u-s--elections-work/what-is-the-contingent-election-and-voting-process-.html

Trump retains the presidency.

Luckily step 10 didnt happen. It all almost did. If Pence had just evacuated Trump would be president right now. Pence literally got all the way to the car and then refused to get in. That's how close it came.

https://www.newsweek.com/mike-pence-refused-car-secret-service-capitol-riot-book-1610326

January 6th was the culmination of a premeditated plot to force the evacuation of the VP from the capitol and stop the certification of the electoral college which would then force a contingent election that would result in Trump retaining the presidency. This scenario did not play out by chance. 

The fact that trump made so many moves to ensure his desired outcome within the 64 days between losing the election on Nov 3rd and the electoral college certification on Jan 6th indicates that this was all premeditated. The decision to have the rally at the exact time and place to stop the certification. Ensuring there would be plenty of people to protest and riot. The placement of pentagon leadership to delay the national guard deployment. Giving the rioters time to achieve the desired goal. His very public meeting to ask Pence to deny the electoral college. His tweet during the riot letting everyone know Pence didn't do it so the rioters had a reason to turn on Pence. The setup of the Willard war room ahead of time for communications. The fact that Trump waited so long to do anything after the violence started. 

After Nov 3rd Trump knew there was a very limited number of ways to retain the presidency with any shred of legal legitimacy. One way would be to get the secretaries of state in battleground states to change vote tallies in Trumps favor due to unproven voter fraud and declare Trump the winner of those states. He tried that, it didn't work. Trump was then left with literally one single path to victory. Stop the certification of the electoral college and force a contingent election.

Trump knew Pence was the lynch pin in the electoral college certification process. All Trump needed was for Pence to evacuate the capitol on Jan 6th and Trump knew that and did everything in his power to make that exact thing happen. 

Trump and company put thousands of lives at risk. From civilians that were his own supporters, to law enforcement, to duly elected members of congress, to his own Vice President of the United States, all in a bid to remain in power.

Pence was attacked/killed and forced to be elsewhere then that would cement stage 10 in your theory. 

According to the article - the plan was to evacuate Pence to Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. But if you are leaving the Capital Building and heading to JBA then you'd have to pass close to the South East side of the Capitol. That's where the DNC and RNC buildings are and where the pipe bombs were found. Authorities stated they didn't know why the pipe bombs didn't go off.

Comment,1,hocnje3,NA,0,1639377575,"Thank you for your contribution to the discussion!

One thing I just want to bring up as a pet peeve of mine is calling the Maga Cult ""Insurrectionists.""

Yes, they did attempt a coup, the pet peeve just comes in because I consider myself an Insurrectionary Anarchist. Our ideas of insurrection are a lot more... refined than what we saw on Jan 6th.

The mob itself is exactly as another contributor mentioned. A stupid mob with little to no plan. Some groups were more organized than others, but overall I can see where the idea that the entire coup attempt was completely brainless comes from if one only observes the crowd.

As for your points, the bomb thing caught my interest as well. I also feel like they didn't really know what they were doing. If chaos is what they wanted, they could of used much easier and cheaper to make fake bombs to the same effect. If they wanted destruction, either they are incompetent or (and take this possibility with a grain of salt) the conditions to blow the bombs were never met, but this possibility I find unlikely too as it would suggest a higher sophistication in planning than the Maga cult has shown prior.

The cop response was entertaining and telling for me. It showed just how fractured police are internally. White Supremacists are the majority in uniform but they aren't the only faction within the police. You got the ""I wanna change it from the inside"" crowd that only ever end up being changed themselves into what they set out to stop or they eventually get forced out. Then you got the bullies who can be distinguished from the white supremacists in only that they're hostile to everyone indiscriminately and are sometimes even hated by other cops.

The white supremacists were divided on the 6th. Some sided with the Maga Cult, others sided with the state that grants them their authority. The bullies and the changers likewise sided with the state for much the same reason. Without the state backing them up, they're nothing but a street gang with a uniform.

Watching the back the blue crowd turn on the cops was icing on the cake for me that day. I despise cops personally. They murdered my nephew. They put themselves on pedestals above communities and only ever escalate situations to ever greater levels of violence. When that agent shot Ashli Babbitt or w/e the fuzz her name was, I admit that I felt nothing but rage at the agent and a strange sympathy for my now dead enemy. Even in that situation, I don't believe she deserved to die.

As for AOC, I feel an ever growing mistrust and contempt for her. I did not buy her panic. It didn't strike me as genuine. If anything, those who remained silent felt more genuine. She said all the right things to get elected but has since been nothing but a performer, some weird jester to stem the hemorrhaging flow of Progressives leaving the party for more leftist ideologies like Communism and my beloved Anarchism.

I feel like the Democrats put the camera on her and hide behind her because they know the old establishment and its tired messaging no longer works to the degree it used too.

As stupid and uneducated as the average American is, the Millennials and Gen Xers are still the most educated and information seeking generations the country has ever seen. I don't think the two parties or even the United States as a whole can keep up the illusion that's been used to dupe past generations with American Exceptionalism.

Even if these two gens aren't the ones to revolt, it's hard to imagine the US outliving me at this point and I'm 32. The way things are going, either the US Government will masks off embrace fascism (which many in leftist circles argue it already has, myself included) and establish, at least for a limited time until WWIII, an iron fisted order, or it will unravel and collapse internally as infrastructure falls apart in the ever growing unrest and resistance against the state.

This will lead to an uncertain and (for us Anarchists at least) exciting time where human potential is no longer shackled by US Authority. What comes of this potential depends on which ""extremist"" group or groups come to power in the post-US world.

Will fascism still win out with American Nazis coming to power? Will freedom and human potential have a chance to thrive in an Anarchist federation? Will we rally and unite like never before under Communism? Will the First Nations see a resurgence?

Only time will tell.",2021-12-13T08:39:35Z

Comment,1,hoclxww,NA,0,1639376490,"Yup. The idea that all women are pro-choice and want unrestricted access to abortion is incorrect and doing a lot of damage. It does tend to be related to extreme religion views, but it's not a male vs female issue.

 

>It's not all religion.

Very true. I'd say it related more to how extreme the individuals are. Catholics are a great example. Lots of Cafeteria Catholic are pro-choice.  

My mom, mid-60's, was talking to some friends recently and abortion came up. All three women she was with are extremely Catholic, they attend mass weekly + all the special masses, were upset their children were ""living in sin,"" etc. but surprisingly they're all pro-choice. One woman had an abortion for medical reasons late in her pregnancy, so the issue was extremely personal for her. I was shocked, they're all Republicans (thankfully my mom's not!) but their own experiences made them pro-choice and same for their husbands. 

Flip side, I worked with a Catholic woman who told me her friend was advised to have an abortion for medical reasons, didn't, and died but it was fine ""because the baby lived."" 

Who's pro-choice and who's anti-abortion is a very individual thing. I do with Democrats would tone down the abortion as birth control talk. I don't care if someone does it for that reason, but in terms of messaging, it's not good when you consider how many people want *some* restrictions on abortion.",2021-12-13T08:21:30Z

1. The Democrats hold the Senate, and he gets another two years to decide or die in office.
