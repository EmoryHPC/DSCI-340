Comment,1,h76kcvr,NA,0,1627719035,"Let the good times roll. Bon ton roulet. Kelly guilfoyle is right right wing right but nevertheless right. The best is yet to come.

The trump crime family's crime spree is over! No executive privilege. DOJ needs more attorneys I'm thinking. We the real people want our inalienable rights to be sure. Freedom comes with responsibility. 

No victims need to apply no People who think they are entitled need to apply please don't whine.  

We the people understand that freedom comes with responsibility when we decided most of us decided to leave a tribal society and join together for the common good we've it's good we agreed that under certain circumstances in circumstances we would submit regardless regardless of how we felt personally we it's out personally we would submit to the business of keeping our fellow Americans alive.

Is who information is coming out about Boston it's Boston and the smallpox epidemic of 19 0 1 and what was said then and what the Supreme Court of the United States of America said then.

Is Al we are a nation of angry victims and those victims are being bled dry is in blood dry by grifters. But they just don't get it and I no longer care if they get it or not.

I don't mind watching hundreds of thousands of backward ignorant jerk's die it doesn't bother me one bit. But I got mental problems I know that and I'm an old man and I just don't care anymore.

Is sick and tired of these people who don't want to work it's not work don't want to go to school don't wantna pay attention want a government handout is a government handout or want to be sovereign yeah baby.

It's unfortunately for me in my state we have 43000 members of militias. Terry Nichols is from here. 
 I have a farm in a backward and ignorant area of my state it's 8 and they've been that way for a long long time it's long time it's not just about the vaccine or the epidemic they can't function in normal society they're not city people they do not like city people they have a whole different code of conduct that works for them them and I respect that period

However when it comes to the common good ignorance is no excuse you want your family members to die because you and them watch Fox News stop it's news stop watching Fox News start getting your information from people who do not make money from telling you horrible things Rupert Murdoch and Lockland murdoch and the murdoch family in Australia are making hundreds of billions of dollars yeah it's a billions of dollars off of fomenting insurrection and lying to the people people it's entertainment they say they say when dominion sues them for 1.6 billion dollars they say oh it's entertainment have you ever heard Tucker Carlson's tone of voice.

Hectoring histrionics sarcasm but hes not laughing. He is not having a good time. He isn't having any fun. How is that entertainment. He is successful I respect that. Joe bonanno the only mafia don to retire was successful. I kinda respect that. 

RICO is no joke. It has asset forfeiture, money houses cars. Probably never happen to trump crime family. Dangerous precedent bsd juju.

 It's fun to think about though 3 o'clock in the morning the feds smack is fed's smash ivanka trump's door down and in her nightgown the handcuffer in front of her children and take her off to jait's brought to jail they seize her house is os in Florida and her property and her husband's property and they put her husband in handcuffs the cubs too they put their children in Foster care.

That's not gonna happen to her she's rich and unfortunately unfortunately another leader we might we might elect another evil president we've done that quite frequently in recent years and he or she could be the other party is the other party I don't know what's gonna happen to the nazi wing of the Republican party because they seem to be in the majority.

But truly brave people like Liz Chaney and Adam kinzigger and I'm not a Democrat or Republican I'm an independent in any case these 2 shining stars stars are going to do business in the name of we the people.

I am a member of weeds of people and I gave up my Is inalienable rights and I went down to the fire station and I got myself vaccinated in spite of the fact that I'm allergic to penicillin and I was wit's dependency on it and I was worried about anaphylactic shock I had that once I survived. 
 I talked to the nurse that talked and it called me on the phone to make the appointment and she said no biggie OK I was down with that period.

So I went to the fire station and told them. They had me wait an extra 15 minutes and I was good to go.

Comment,1,h76hdk6,NA,0,1627716410,"I'm reminded of Isaac Asimov's essay [The Relativity of Wrong](http://mvellend.recherche.usherbrooke.ca/Asimov_anglosaboteurs.pdf). Here's a key section:

>The young specialist in English Lit, having quoted me, went on to lecture me severely on the fact that in every century people have thought they understood the universe at last, and in every century they were proved to be wrong. It follows that the one thing we can say about our modern ""knowledge"" is that it is wrong. The young man then quoted with approval what Socrates had said on learning that the Delphic oracle had proclaimed him the wisest man in Greece. ""If I am the wisest man,"" said Socrates, ""it is because I alone know that I know nothing."" the implication was that I was very foolish because I was under the impression I knew a great deal.  
  
>  
>My answer to him was, ""John, when people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.""  
  
>  
>The basic trouble, you see, is that people think that ""right"" and ""wrong"" are absolute; that everything that isn't perfectly and completely right is totally and equally wrong.  
  
>  
>However, I don't think that's so. It seems to me that right and wrong are fuzzy concepts, and I will devote this essay to an explanation of why I think so.

So, as you say, changing recommendations is what is expected rather than being an indication of a problem with the process. Many people see professionals that use scientific methods to make policy recommendations changing their recommendations and go, ""aha, I knew it was all made up!"" When the reality is that recommendations changing as data changes is exactly what is expected.

This is the key difference between making decisions based on gut feelings and ""common sense"" (something that doesn't actually exist) and making decisions based upon techniques built upon the scientific method. The scientific method was invented specifically to break humanity away from making decisions based on feelings and anecdotes and towards making decisions based upon rational processes and reliable data. Yet so many people still cling to anecdotes and feelings because they were never properly taught what the scientific method is (or willfully ignored such instruction).",2021-07-31T10:26:50Z

Comment,1,h7783sr,NA,0,1627738362,"K let's ignore her 2012 stunt to show how stupid bills limiting women's reproductive health options were.. I'll quote from Wikipedia what she did.

> As a political statement against legislation attempting to restrict women's access to contraception and abortion, in March 2012, Turner introduced a bill to regulate men's reproductive health. Before getting a prescription for erectile dysfunction drugs, a man would have to get a notarized affidavit signed by a recent sexual partner affirming his impotency, consult with a sex therapist and receive a cardiac stress test. She said the proposed statute would be parallel to recent legislation written by male legislators restricting women's reproductive health and that she was equally concerned about men's reproductive health. **The proposed legislation was not meant to be passed, but as a way of bringing attention to similar bills targeted towards women.**

It's easy to pick out parts we don't like from a politicians career. There isn't a single politician I like that hasn't done one thing or another where I'd say ""k that's not cool"". But as a whole, I like the politician for getting things right most of the time.

So do you think that would have cancelled the election?  Seriously?  At worst it would have been briefly delayed while it got certified at a different location.  You act like it would been called off and Trump would have stayed in office.

> People died in 9/11 and it traumatized the psyche of our nation, but at no point was our nation ever actually at risk. January 6th almost marked the death of our nation and the birth of fascist dictatorship in its place.

This is such nonsense.  How do you get yourself so worked up into thinking this would have caused the nation to fall?  There was zero chance of that.  Hell, I think you know this but it helps your political cause to act like it was the equivalent of the French Revolution.

An example locally. For years, we had this congressman named Tim Murphy. Now, he wasn't quite so bad as Republicans go (I mean he was still a Republican so I held him in fairly low esteem, but higher esteem than most of the others), but he was also a pro-life, family values type. Then in 2017 it came out he'd had an affair with a 32 year old woman and then tried to get her to have an abortion. He had to resign because the voters here were disgusted with him and Conor Lamb won the special election to replace him. So there are some Republicans who would have to resign, it's just not the craziest ones because their voters are often just as terrible as they are.",2021-08-11T09:34:16Z

One video showed a parent who wanted kids to wear masks being attacked, screamed at, threatened  by a parking lot full of parents who were antimaskers. If this man were not in his car, I'm thinking he could have easily have ended up in the hospital. No exaggeration. Men screaming ""we know where you live! You'll never be able to go out in public again!"" They kept repeating it. 

 At a meeting for parents inside (I'm not sure if this was the same place in TN),  a respiratory therapist and a pediatrician, both parents there,  were trying to get parents to consider putting masks on their children. Both were heckled. 

I've never seen anything this bad about masks in schools.  The level of anger was really frightening. They could have been like, so, you put a mask on your kid but we won't. But no, they were so viscous! These were parents! What's next? Their kids will mock or beat up kids who wear masks? 

I live in one of the largest cities in NY, right next to NYC. There haven't been things like this.  There haven't been meetings for my district over this. No doubt there will be some who won't send their kids in with masks or get them vaccinated if they're old enough, so we'll see what happens after school opens.

Actors, you want actors. Or at the very least people who will happily pander to the American stereotype. Thats the kind of thinking that got people like Reagan elected. People who can lie to your face and make you feel good about believing it.

Nobody thats been president in the last 30 years is down to earth. The fact is, there is a blueprint that every good politician copies to appear the way the average person expects of them. Women in politics just don’t fit the mold yet and we will see it time and again with people like Hilary. Whether people admit it, or don’t even know they have this bias conciously, a “strong” woman doesn’t fit the mold people want. So we will go the extra mile to find things about them we don’t like. The opposite happens with strong white men in politics, we will be more forgiving of weaknesses. We see this across every industry. Am I saying Hilary should have won? No. But people disliked her for more than her policies whether they know it or not. 

Frankly, this just shows, America is incapable as a population of electing a president that is actually good for the job, probably because 99.98% of Americans aren’t qualified to hire an employee let alone decide on one of the most powerful people in the world.

The rioting and looting during the BLM protests/riots last year wasn’t done by only BLM. In fact:

> Some of those facing charges undoubtedly share far-left and anti-government views. Far-right protesters also have been arrested and charged. Some defendants have driven to protests from out of state. Some have criminal records and were illegally carrying weapons. Others are accused of using the protests as an opportunity to steal or create havoc. [AP article](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-race-and-ethnicity-suburbs-health-racial-injustice-7edf9027af1878283f3818d96c54f748) and a friendly reminder, AP is rated center bias.

However, for the January 6th insurrection, the FBI looked into those who stormed the Capitol and:

> FBI Director Chris Wray on Tuesday debunked conspiracy theories promoted by right-wing supporters of former President Donald Trump, saying there was no evidence that leftist extremists disguised themselves as Trump supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol. [Reuters Article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-senate-fbi-extremists-new-idUSKCN2AU22P) Reuters is also center bias.

Looks like it wasn’t just BLM or leftists causing the property damage it was right wingers too, but it was predominantly Republicans that attacked the Capitol. Seems like misplaced anger then, huh Republicans?

But that’s besides the fact that January 6th was the first non-peaceful transfer of power in US history. Their intent was to overthrow the election, which is an affront to American democracy. They claim Blue Lives Matter, but none of the Blue Lives mattered that day as they crush, struck, sprayed, and beat those officers to overthrow the election. Some used that opportunity to rummage through sensitive information, with one woman taking a laptop in efforts to share it with Russia. In fact, the least worse thing that the insurgents did that day was property damage, the number one complaint from the right over the BLM riots.

Lastly, look at how many insurgents went home that day and needed to be tracked down by the FBI compared to the rioters and looters who were arrested by police.

There’s no comparison. The crimes of property damage should never be held above crimes against American democracy, but here we are, where even peaceful BLM protesters were arrested while January 6th rioters parade around in public and social media like partaking in an insurgency against the country is a badge of honor.

While hormonal treatments for women have some of the same side effects they were considered more severe overall and even cause one person to attempt suicide. Overall the issue is women are often able to handle hormone changes more fluidly than men, mostly because thats what a woman's body does, men will have a pretty consistent testosterone level throughout life after puberty, it may decrease but its gradual and sudden decreases are cause of some male specific issues.

The case of r accounts for such a small number of abortion cases it's a bit of a misdirection unless your advocating for abortion only in case where the mother has been rd which I'm sure you're not. 

But I will discuss the point you made up. If a woman is rd it is not the babies fault. She will live with the mental scars of the incident all her life.

>Texas' law delegates to private individuals the power to prevent a woman from obtaining an abortion during the first stage of pregnancy.

&nbsp;
>And the applicants, with supporting affidavits, claim the clinics will be unable to run the financial and other risks that come from waiting for a private person to sue them under the Texas law; they will simply close, depriving care to more than half the women seeking abortions in Texas clinics.

From Sotomayor's dissent:

>The Act authorizes any private citizen to file a lawsuit against any person who provides an abortion in violation of the Act, ""aids or abets"" such an abortion (including paying for it) regardless of whether they know the abortion is prohibited under the Act, or even intends to engage in such conduct. Courts are required to enjoin the defendant from engaging in these actions in the future and to award the private-citizen plaintiff at least $10,000 in ""statutory damages"" for each forbidden abortion performed or aided by the defendant. In effect, the Texas Legislature has deputized the State’s citizens as bounty hunters, offering them cash prizes for civilly prosecuting their neighbors’ medical procedures.

>The Legislature fashioned this scheme because federal constitutional challenges to state laws ordinarily are brought against state officers who are in charge of enforcing the law. By prohibiting state officers from enforcing the Act directly and relying instead on citizen bounty hunters, the Legislature sought to make it more complicated for federal courts to enjoin the Act on a statewide basis.",2021-09-02T09:21:43Z

Comment,1,hdquqiz,NA,0,1632247356,"Obviously my sarcasm is lost on you.

Yours is a purely unscientific approach to the concept of life.  If you want to get technical, after spermatozoa reach the interior of the ovum, they are absorbed after donating their genetic material.  They cease being individual cells and join to become one.

The real debate here, one for which you've offered no arguments, is when does this cell become a ""person"" with all the rights and privileges of a human being?

There are all sorts of philosophical and religious arguments for when personhood begins.  None of them are rooted in science.

You seem to think all of the rights of personhood should be conferred at conception.  This implicitly places the rights of the unborn ahead of those of their mother, far before that clump of cells becomes anything even close to resembling a human being.  

The implication here, of course, is that the rights of a woman are suspended when she is pregnant - she suddenly becomes a vessel beholden to an entity which cannot survive outside of the womb and whose rights are somehow more important than her own.

How do we make sure women adhere to these rules?  We would need to implement some sort of pregnancy database where the government can track all unborn children to make sure their rights are preserved.  This is a concept directly out of A Handmaidens Tale.",2021-09-21T21:02:36Z

Comment,1,hdqssga,NA,0,1632246550,"Again, I honestly don't believe centrism is the solution to the problems plaguing the country.  You aren't going to mitigate the devastating effects of climate change or police brutality/excessive force or fix health care with centrism propping up the status quo. It wasn't just to prevent downvotes.

Hyperpolarization leads to *demonizing* people across the aisle which will destroy our democracy.  Most people who believe conservative ideals are usually fundamentally decent hardworking people.  Most were just misled on masks, vaccines and voter fraud and have taken to politics like a team sport (which our side does as well).

For example with policing, I truly believe we need radical overhauling of policing in this country and am viscerally angry when I hear stories [like this one](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/philly-pays-2m-to-mom-who-was-beaten-by-police-during-unrest/2958402/) (black woman driving home from work with kid in car, randomly encounters police at a protest, tries to turn around but cops break into her car, drag her out, beat her, take her toddler from the car, and use the kid in a photo op by police union for how police protect us from violence right before the election -- I can 100% see that happening to my family), but we also cannot demonize all cops as being ""evil"" and the ""enemy"".    Qualified immunity, inadequate training where police can't identify health disorders or de-escalate situations, and police unions protecting shitty cops who've attack the public are the enemy.

But you will also see memes and propaganda that attempts to drive a wedge too far on these issues.  People saying shit like ""ACAB"" (when plenty of decent folk do police work) or ignoring/downplaying police brutality towards non-black people (yes there is more police brutality problem with black people).

You’re also required to take 1 day every month for mental health and if you work there for at least 5 years, you’re eligible to take a year off studying or doing whatever so long as it pertains to your work or makes you develop a skillset that can be related to your work.

https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Santorum%20Surge

Santorum Surge
A homosexual sex act involving ten (10) or more males, popularized by several conservative politicians.

During this act each participant lines up according to penis size and voraciously jackhammers the male with the tightest cornhole (""receiver"") until they ejaculate, one at a time filling the colon with an emulsion of personal lubricant and fecal matter (""Santorum"").

Next, the second most hung male penetrates the colon extremely deeply and performs the most aggressive form of anal intercourse done at such a speed/force that the anus loses all tightness and what was once a happy starfish is now a hot red pit (""code red anal"").

Simultaneously, while the receiver is fluffing the most hung male and getting absolutely throttled in the ass, the most hung male grabs the back of the receiver's head and forces the receiver to deep throat beyond his capability.

The violent gag that results sets off a chain reaction that begins with a sphincter clench. The combination of this clench with a well-timed inward thrust from the #2 douche rocket creates a massive high-pressure colon-bubble that explodes at a high velocity from the receivers gaping colon, covering the #2 douche rocket in a mixed batch of steamy Santorum.",2021-10-23T11:44:24Z

We are trying to get our current employees a raise above that so we can remain competitive. In all cases upper management is dragging their heels. Telling us they'll think about our proposals blah blah blah. The four of us are all experiencing the same thing. Two or three applicants a week and when we interview it's more misses than hits. No one wants to work in customer service right now and I don't blame them. During the height of the pandemic when everything was shut down we were all swamped. Tips were great and none of us work in places where tipping is a thing. People were super nice for the most part. Definitely fewer assholes then we've ever experienced in our collective memories. But a switch flipped. As soon as the restrictions started to go away people got worse. Worse than we had seen in a long time! You wouldn't believe how bad it's gotten. It is so hard finding people that want to work front line or stay on the front of house after a while. I can hire four people and three quit in three weeks. It's nuts. None of us are having any luck building back. We have good people mind you that are making a competitive wage locally, we aren't afraid to call around to see what others are paying. It was never the stimulus checks that led to any of this. I think people that had experience in these jobs got a break at some point, either sales dropped and they got laid off, they got their first two weeks PTO (via the unemployment +stimulus I'm not blowing smoke up anyone ass here) in their lives because of a quarantine situation or they lost affordable child care and now they can't afford to come back to work full time. It is such a complex situation. I believe the biggest crux for us is the Federal minimum wage not getting raised. Our collective bosses are all the kind of people that would pay us less but it's against the law. One of us took a walk around a week ago. The other three of us are getting close.

Yet these same Republicans have yet to demonstrate even the smallest amount of evidence that would hint at the existence of what would logically have to be hundreds of mega sized operations.

When the stock market does well, those stocks raise in value. This is why he's the richest man in the world, for now, at least.

When the stocks raise in value, there's a difference between what they were originally and what they were after they raised in value. This is the gain.

Some of that gain can be siphoned off in the form of a tax. While this will certainly effect the strength of the stock market, I believe that spending that siphoned-off money - and the money siphoned off of the growing assets of other billionaires - on Biden's $1.5 trillion bill will ultimately cause the US economy to generate more value than was lost.

You gotta spend money to make money. Musk knows that, and so does the Fed.

Also, this is not (full-on, at least) socialism, nor is it communism, which I'm glad for, because I really don't like those two ideologies because they crush the individual drive to succeed and stifle innovation because greed is no longer a motivator. Socialism is the people controlling the means of production, and communism is the government controlling the means of production (both oversimplifications, but those are the gist of those ideologies). These are just taxes, and taxes that I really like.

A birth so unwanted, the person couldn't be bothered to not have sex to avoid having said unwanted birth? Doesn't seem very unwanted to me.

>You are describing forcing women to give birth. Forced birth.

Is it a ""forced birth"" to tell a woman she can't have an abortion on her 38th week of pregnancy? Don't we as a society already tell most 30-39 week mothers that they have to carry their babies to term? 

The woman isn't forced to give birth, she's just prevented from seeing a doctor who will destroy her fetus. 

> It's way more applicable than the incredibly loaded and euphemistic ""pro life"", you know,

This isn't a very compelling argument.  

Only in extreme cases is a mother's life threatened during pregnancy.  And, in those cases, I absolutely think the mother's life should take priority over the fetus'  because she has consciousness and they don't.  

This analogy does not help at all with main question, which is, in cases where the mother's life is not in jeopardy, does the fetus' have a right to live and does that right to live supersede the mother's bodily autonomy?

Just because it's an inconvenient and difficult question, doesn't mean we should sweep it under the rug for the sake of pragmatism.  

Where life begins is of paramount importance.  Because if you kill something which is endowed with the right to live, then that is murder.  

I have a hard time justifying murder unless the mother's life is in danger due to her pregnancy.  I understand that pregnancy and child birth are traumatic for the body -- I can't even imagine -- but I just can't value being spared that over the life of something that will become a child.

Whether a fetus has rights or is alive affects everyone.  Fetuses become both men and women.  If abortion is a form of murder (even if justified), then it implicates all of us.  

I'd add that it takes two people to make a baby.  Men might not carry the child, but having a child or not having a child does quite literally affect them.  Not in the same manner of women of course.",2021-12-03T08:16:52Z

Well, fair enough.  But there's actually two questions buried in here:

(1) Does the potential for life matter from a moral perspective?

(2) Should the potential for life outweigh a female's bodily autonomy.  

I believe taking life is the most serious societal ill.  So I absolutely think it takes precedent over a woman's bodily autonomy.

Cliché as it is to say, there’s a reason countries have never invaded the US and it’s partially due to the amount of guns the citizenry has here. Any foreign army would not only be against the most well armed military, but the most well armed citizens. 

I do agree that something needs to be done to curb gun violence in this country and it starts with mandatory gun safety training, I’m talking very stringent training here. And, additionally, much harsher penalties for illegal weapons. While we wasted resources and man hours in the “war on drugs”, it really should’ve been geared towards illegal firearms. Maybe, going forward, those same funds allocated to bullshit arrests for grams of weed should be reallocated to investigating, arresting and throwing the book at anyone who obtains, sells or even tries to obtain firearms illegally. 

While I understand that school shootings are committed mostly with legally sought firearms, this is because children who do these shootings don’t understand how or where to obtain guns illegally so they take their parents. Yes, this is obviously a fault of the parents for not locking up their weapons…but my point is that *most* gun violence in this country happens on the streets with mostly illegally obtained weapons. 

This problem is multifaceted and requires a multi pronged, nuanced approach. Banning the legal purchase, carry of weapons will not curb most of the violence in the US.

Comment,1,hnkt8c5,NA,0,1638872251,"> Authors would, for example, write “lxs participantes” to avoid the masculine “los” in the phrase “the participants.”

??????????

The word ""gender"" has a different meaning in language than it does in other affairs. That is actually where the term arose, and it was not associated with identity until much later. The word ""Los"" is masculine, but ""masculine"" simply does not have anything to do with identity in that context, at all. The word could be replaced with another without breaking its meaning, or that of ""masculine"" when used in the context of identity.

These people are conflating the meaning of a word when used in two completely different contexts. ""Los participantes"" does not cast the participants as having any gender identity.

For that matter, ""Mano"" is feminine. I am a man. Does that mean my hands are ""female gendered"" as opposed to the rest of me?",2021-12-07T12:17:31Z

But what about JFK? He cheated with a younger Marilyn Monroe. And Bill Clinton went a step further and screwed with an intern ( who had feelings for Bill). Are you a guy? Has every woman you’ve ever did anything with been out of love or maybe…maybe those juices were just flowing? I know I’ve had my share of picking up women at bars and ending up out in a car and maybe then back home. I’m sure Bill got along well and ‘liked’ Monica as well. And it was all consensual. I think Hillary hung on because she wanted to work it out for Bill. No doubt she loves him. 

But they are not murdering people. Why are you spreading this complete bullshit and then bringing up their sex life and there marriage problems.

Your body is your body and no one can force you to do anything for the sake of someone else. Unless you're a woman who is pregnant.

Megathread: Supreme Court Allows Challenge to Texas Abortion Law but Leaves It in Effect,2565,rdbf1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/rdbf1i/megathread_supreme_court_allows_challenge_to/,1310,1639151006,"This morning, the Supreme Court of the United States issued opinions for *Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson* and *United States v. Texas.* Both cases addressed Texas Law S.B. 8. that banned abortion procedures after six weeks of pregnancy and authorized private civil right of action related to violations of the law. The latter authorization allowed private citizens, including citizens residing outside of the state of Texas, to bring civil actions against individuals for aiding a patient with getting an abortion. In both cases, plaintiffs argued that S.B. 8 violated *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.

In *United States v. Texas,* the court issued a per curiam ruling, dismissing the petitioner's request for a stay on the enforcement of S.B. 8. In *Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson*, the court released an 8-1 ruling allowing abortion providers to sue state licensing officers, and a 5-4 ruling denying providers the ability to sue state court clerks. Chief Justice Roberts wrote  ""The District Court should resolve this litigation and enter appropriate relief without delay.""

Comment,1,hoclxww,NA,0,1639376490,"Yup. The idea that all women are pro-choice and want unrestricted access to abortion is incorrect and doing a lot of damage. It does tend to be related to extreme religion views, but it's not a male vs female issue.

 

>It's not all religion.

Very true. I'd say it related more to how extreme the individuals are. Catholics are a great example. Lots of Cafeteria Catholic are pro-choice.  

My mom, mid-60's, was talking to some friends recently and abortion came up. All three women she was with are extremely Catholic, they attend mass weekly + all the special masses, were upset their children were ""living in sin,"" etc. but surprisingly they're all pro-choice. One woman had an abortion for medical reasons late in her pregnancy, so the issue was extremely personal for her. I was shocked, they're all Republicans (thankfully my mom's not!) but their own experiences made them pro-choice and same for their husbands. 

Flip side, I worked with a Catholic woman who told me her friend was advised to have an abortion for medical reasons, didn't, and died but it was fine ""because the baby lived."" 

Who's pro-choice and who's anti-abortion is a very individual thing. I do with Democrats would tone down the abortion as birth control talk. I don't care if someone does it for that reason, but in terms of messaging, it's not good when you consider how many people want *some* restrictions on abortion.",2021-12-13T08:21:30Z

1. The Democrats hold the Senate, and he gets another two years to decide or die in office.
2. The Democrats lose the Senate, but win it back and hold the Presidency in 2024, and he lives past 86.
3. The Democrats lose the Senate next year, and the Presidency in 2024, but win back both in 2028, and he lives past 90.
